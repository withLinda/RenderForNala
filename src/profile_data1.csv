4,Saso P.,Skopje,Sound Artist | Sound Designer | Audio Engineer,"Hello there, 🖖 Welcome to my Upwork profile!  

I&#039;m an audio specialist with nearly two decades of keen passion and scrupulous dedication in the field. I&#039;ve been carefully crafting my skills and experience while always keeping a sharp eye + ear on what is current and upcoming in the industry, and I&#039;m proud to be able to say that, so far I’ve been involved in the creation of more than a hundred interactive and/or narrative-based multimedia projects where delicate audio was always an integral part of the development process. 

These projects span multiple platforms and systems, ranging from interactive apps and video games for mobile, web, and desktop consoles to sound design and audio implementation for various hardware devices, such as electronic toys for children, casino game slots and self-containing sound machines for relaxation purposes and all the way to microscopic sound design for cutting-edge wireless earphone devices. 

Over the past couple of years, I&#039;ve also had the opportunity to complete sound design, post-production and re-recording mixing for 2 feature-length documentary titles as well as a few short animations and art-house movies, some of which are also highlighted in my portfolio here on Upwork.   

My current interests revolve around audio development and sound implementation for video games and immersive multimedia experiences as well as sound design and spatial audio mixing for various media art and VR projects, including multichannel sound installations and site-specific walkthrough A/V experiences.  

If you have a project or a position you think I might be interested in, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

11,Simon K.,Sao Paulo,Music Producer and Sound Designer,"Whether you are a one person company or a big enterprise; an independent artist or a label one, if you are here, it probably means you need to hand over your baby (lyrics, video, ad, animation, or an idea) to a music producer / sound designer. It’s a pretty scary moment since you’ve put a lot of effort and care on it. I guess…

1. You need someone you can trust and that’s not simply trying to sell you a service. Great Communication, Clear Workflow, and Trackable Pricing are essential to give you peace of mind regarding what&#039;s being done, and the quality of the deliverables;

2. You need someone who knows their craft with proven productions and portfolio. Your project shouldn&#039;t be handed over to a novice with no experience, or to someone who just wants to get positive feedback in Upwork;

3. You need someone who listens and understand your vision.

I’ve been producing music since 2002 (21 years), and my goal is to see your project thriving. I have worked with some world-known names like Sony Music, Jamie Oliver, Nespresso, Little Angel, Hubspot, and Smirnoff.  I&#039;m in Upwork&#039;s top 3%, with 100% positive feedback.

69,Micah K.,New York City,"Music Producer, Mix Engineer and Audio Mastering Specialist.","I&#039;m a producer, mix engineer, mastering engineer, and recording engineer with past clients such as: 
- Republic Records
- Aaron Hagan (Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, Meghan Trainor)
- Andy Cardenas (Madonna, Boys II Men, Lil Kim)
- Carl Sturken (Rihanna, Kelly Clarkson) 
- CBS
- Jack Payne (over 2 million plays) 

I also hold a Master&#039;s degree in Music Technology from NYU. I&#039;ve worked across practically every genre on hip-hop, pop, RnB, jazz, and full orchestras recorded for playback in surround sound and Dolby Atmos. 

I&#039;m experienced in Pro Tools, Logic Pro, and Ableton Live. I&#039;m able to provide guidance on how to properly license your songs, protect your copyrights, and ensure that you&#039;re collecting the revenue that you&#039;re entitled to.  

Beneath you&#039;ll find some testimonials from past clients.

✓ “The vocal sounds like a much higher price mic was used. It’s kind of amazing how you got this to sound. Right off the bat, it is SOOOOO appealing. You do first-rate work!” 

- Aaron Hagan (Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez)
_______________________________________________________________________

- Audio Mastering:
Using a combination of analog and digital gear, I have a history of success mastering pop, hip-hop, orchestral works, and podcasts. Whether you&#039;re looking for a subtle shaping or an aggressive radio-ready record, I have the experience to make your audio shine.

✓ “Best communication I’ve had with an engineer, plus amazing work. This dude really delivers, and is versatile, being able to handle many different genres.”

- Music Production:
As a producer, my skills as a pianist/guitarist, audio engineer, music composer, and artistic director come together so that I can facilitate your art reaching its highest potential both creatively and professionally. 

✓ “Micah absolutely blew me away on this project. High levels musicianship, professionalism, industry insight, and technical expertise like this rarely co-exist. Would definitely hire again” 

- Music Mixing:
A great mix can make or break a record, no question about it. For me, mixing is about more than &quot;getting a good balance&quot;, it&#039;s about creating the world the artist envisions. 

✓ &quot;Micah, you completely brought this project to life, it&#039;s exactly what I imagined. I swear you&#039;re equal parts, mind reader and audio engineer.&quot;

- Audio Restoration:
I&#039;m highly experienced using spectral editing for the removal of room noise, harsh “s/t/k” sounds, pops, clicks, and even dogs barking in the background. If it can be saved, I can save it. 

✓ &quot;I&#039;m so happy we worked together. This performance was a once in a lifetime event, and you breathed a new life into the recording&quot;

- Vocal Tuning and Alignment: 
I tune vocals by hand to provide much more transparent results than AutoTune or even Melodyne. I also align vocals to create tight doubles and harmonies, providing a larger sounding, cleaner sound. 

The testimonial for this service is from a really talented UK artist and it&#039;s probably my favorite review...

✓&quot;No joke, this pitch cleanup is so hard to detect it&#039;s scary.&quot;

86,Quinn G.,Doylestown,Podcast Manager | Media Producer,"Hello UpWork, I’m Quinn. In my consulting business, I have launched 10 podcasts and produced over 150 podcast episodes (totaling over 900 hours of audio editing, sound design, and mixing among them). The best news? None of my clients are experiencing podfade.

What&#039;s podfade you might ask? It&#039;s when you&#039;re excited about your podcast, launch it, and then realize between recording, chasing after guests, editing, and not knowing the audio engineering to make it sound how you want...this thing is a full-time job. 

That&#039;s why you&#039;re reading this. I produce and manage podcasts, so you can focus on your job, your kids, or networking with new guests (or writing if you&#039;re a solocaster--yes you can do it alone!).  

Common pain points I help people with:

- How many episodes do I need to launch?
- Do I need an episode every week? 
- What mic do I get? (hint: it&#039;s not the blue yeti)
- Can I use Zoom to record my remote guest (yes...but do you instead want to represent your brand better if the tools existed--because they do!) 
- How do I get ADs? (it&#039;s complicated - but maybe you don&#039;t need them?)
- How much money can I make with my podcast?

When we start, I begin by listening to you. What do you need? What are you overwhelmed by in starting your project? Once we figure that out, I will create a custom production plan based on your needs. 

I coach you through the steps to make your podcast sustainable for you or your business. 

The clients I choose to work with are seeking something different, something more than average to serve the people they seek to reach. I help them achieve that.

If you want to create a podcast that thoughtfully serves the people in your audience or community, all I ask is that you are willing to learn along the way. If you think I might be a good fit for your project, please reach out to me I&#039;d be happy to schedule a free discovery call with you!

Over the years I started composing music for short films and video commercials. 

It has remained my greatest love and biggest challenge ever since - to create something out of nothing. 

The skills such as mixing, mastering and editing come naturally from the need to present my work in the best way possible. And it is still a learning curve with every new project. 

So far I have written, composed and published over 50 songs, did tens of video commercials, five audio books, spent a decade with voice actors overdubbing cartoons, and became a casting director. It has resulted in a high level of expertise in working with various kinds of vocals.

98,Yves M.,Longueuil,Composer - Sound Designer,"I am Yves Matar, a Canadian sound designer and composer for Visual Media. My father being a sound engineer, I have been around studios since very young, and found my passion to be in sound. I have found a deep fascination for game audio specifically, especially when working on my thesis, where I produced my own VR game on Unreal paired with FMOD following the life of Gibran Khalil Gibran, and studied how different intervallic sizes in microtonal elements paired with the sonic soundscape could alter the emotive perception of the scenario one is in.

Though my experience has been primarily in linear media, I find myself increasingly drawn to interactive media. I have worked on sound design, composition, and dubbing in French and Arabic for TV series, documentaries, and films for the past 8 years. As a freelancer, I have worked on several orchestration projects for local and international artists with production houses such as “Haut de Gamme”, and engineers such as Eddy Jazra. I have also worked on sound design and music for documentaries and short films with international companies such as &quot;Universal Media and Publishing&quot; in the Sultanate of Oman. One of the tracks made for a short promotional video there earned me a spot among the top 10 winners in the second round of the Oticons Faculty International Film Music Competition. I was also a music engraver for Korean TV series “Meow: The Secret Boy”, and “Queen: Love and War” with composer Hagyeong Yeo. With the current situation in the world, I am using the quarantine to produce my own DotA 2 music pack.

Most importantly, I believe our main focus should be to pour our hearts into projects we can look back to and be proud of, and I would use everything I have to this end.

I have experience working in all areas of audio design and production, from creating music in my home studio to leading studio sessions and recording, mixing, and mastering music in a professional studio environment. 

Recently I graduated from Abertay University where I studied Sound Design and Music for Games. Whilst at university I developed the skills needed to apply my audio design and production knowledge to the games industry. I learned how to work with development teams, design audio specifically for games, create evolving music and soundscapes as well as how to use middleware to implement the audio myself. I have created sound and music for video, game trailers as well as re-dubs of video clips for assignments. I worked on multiple games projects one of which was shown at EGX as part of Dare Academy 2019. 

I am part of a team that founded 3030 Games (3030games.co.uk) where I continue to work on games development both as an Audio Designer and Games Designer. Our game Ephemera won Best Original Audio at the Game Parade 2020 Game Jam.

132,Drew S.,Austin,Audio Engineer/Sound Designer,"Growing up in a family with myriad different cultural backgrounds, I started early with an appreciation for a broad range of ideas and perspectives. Equally early, I developed an immense love for music and sound, beginning as an avid listener and eventually picking up drumsticks as my primary means of expression.

I began my career in university, holding the titles Extreme Music Coordinator and Music Director at WBUL at USF in Tampa, FL. I then graduated with an Associate’s degree in Recording Arts and a Master’s in Entertainment Business from Full Sail in Orlando, FL. During my time there, I was chosen to participate in the competitive Full Sail Dubbing Stage internship program, as well as assisting for F.O.H. mixer at the Live at Park Ave. Series.

After university, I spent almost 2 years teaching English in Japan, fulfilling one of my early dreams to experience the country first-hand. During my stay, I rehearsed, played live, and recorded with 3 bands, and taught English at 3 different high schools. After moving back to the States, I started working back in my native Florida, while performing with Lion Choir and The Wallies, several music/dance collaborations, improvisational events, and playing cover band gigs.

Within 2 years I made the move to Austin, TX for the thriving music scene, working at Guitar Center and eventually getting a job at MOOD Media as a Production Engineer. Then making a move to Encore (formerly PSAV) as Audio Technician, and then Sales Coordinator. 

Why I&#039;m a great candidate for your project:

Audio:

•	Recording/Editing/Mixing -- I have extensive experience with the breadth of music production across genres and applications, including popular music, classical, and theatrical productions.
•	Audio post-production -- Dialogue editing and placement, spotting, SFX placement, foley, and ADR. 
•	Composition &amp; SFX creation -- For a multitude of visual arts accompaniment including film, dance, live productions.
•	Education -- Drums and percussion lessons as well as recording and DAW fundamentals

Design &amp; Development:

•	Website building -- I&#039;ve built my own websites using CMSes like Wix and SquareSpace and have some experience with coding HTML.
•      Programming -- Completed WGU Python 4 pilot intensive program
•	Graphic design -- I&#039;ve worked on plenty of my album artwork, posters, flyers, and promotional materials for my music projects, friends, and freelance jobs. I have an eye for layout, and I work primarily in Photoshop and Illustrator.
•	Copywriting &amp; marketing -- I&#039;ve written promotional materials for my own shows, dozens of other creative projects, and office jobs. I have also drafted project proposals to be used in grant proposals which require a detail-oriented and concise approach to communicating.

Coordinating:

•	Communication -- As Sales Coordinator for Encore, I acted as liaison between the clients, the W Hotel (which housed my location), and the audio-visual technicians that worked on events that I helped plan. This experience has helped sharpen my interpersonal communication skills in-person, on the phone, and through e-mail.
•	Productivity tools -- At Encore, I also learned software systems for project scheduling, gear acquisition, and CRM, including proprietary tools. I feel confident that I can learn to use your systems and I look forward to learning your workflow.
•	Freelancing -- I have been freelancing for over 10 years as a drummer, audio engineer, and composer. For the last 3 years I have also been working remotely from my home office/studio. 

Here is a list of productivity software that I have used throughout my career:

- Slack
- Jira
- Trello
- Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Apple processors (Pages, Keynote, Numbers)
- Extranet applications

After hours I produce music under my name and my Silver Tapes moniker, do session work, compose music for dance, and continue exploring my home, Austin, TX.

If you are looking for a podcast editor who can take your raw recording and transform them into professional-sounding podcats then you are at the right place! If you have regular based, weekly episodes let us build a long-term relationship and make a great podcast together!

I&#039;m a sound engineer with a bachelor&#039;s degree in audio engineering and a lot of practical experience in podcast editing and post-production. 

You can expect all your audio material to be treated with maximal care because I&#039;m very passionate about sound and I&#039;m always tending to give my best to achieve maximal audio quality. That&#039;s why I decide to be a specialized podcast engineer and I build a special working system for podcast editing. 

So, here is a quick introduction to my workflow. Your podcast will go through four editing stages and three rounds of listening. 

In the first stage, the technical quality of your recording will be increased by removing some downsides of recording like background noise, stems loudness variation, mouth and digital clicks. 

The second and third stage are called “cutting” and “polish” stage where I cut all unnecessary content like non-content audio, mistakes, filler words (“ahms”, too frequent “right”, “you know”....), long pauses, reducing loudness of breaths, removing microphone rumbles and some background sounds if occurs.

The fourth stage is the post-production stage where I&#039;m giving your podcat the best possible quality by using various tools like equalizers, compressor, multichannel compressor, de-esser, enhancers and many others from my big collection. Your episode will get mastered to -16 LUFS to meet podcasts loudness standard.

Here is a list of skills and services that I can offer you:

🎧 Removing background noise and hum
🎧 Evening stems loudness
🎧 Removing mouth clicks, lip smacks, digital clicks
🎧 Removing filler words (“ahms”, too frequent “right”, “you know”....)
🎧 Removing long pauses
🎧 Removing and reducing breaths
🎧 Removing microphone rumbles
🎧 Reducing or removing background sounds
🎧 Splicing main-content audio together with music, episode-intro, podcast-intro, the ad reads, offer reads, call to actions, sound effects
🎧 Applying various post-production tools like equalizers, compressor, multichannel compressor, de-esser, enhancers...
🎧 Mastering episode loudness to -16 LUFS (podcats loudness standard)
🎧 ID3 tagging
🎧 Publishing episodes on the podcast host

Since 2008 I have been in the radio business.  I&#039;ve worked for several companies in Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky.  Throughout the time I have been featured in commercials, radio shows and podcasts. 

Once I noticed how these types of things are made, I took on the role of a freelancer that way others can get high quality audio that I&#039;m used to working with on the radio every single day.  

My strengths include fluency in Adobe Audition, voice overs and audio editing.  

I have edited audio for Ownage Pranks on YouTube, iInspire in California and have even worked with former game show host Pat Finn on a guided meditation CD.

158,Jason C.,Los Angeles,"Trend-savvy Electronic Music Producer, Composer, and DJ","🌎 It&#039;s me, Jason. Wonder what I can do for you? 

I&#039;m a music artist with 5+ years of Music Production, Songwriting, and Mixing &amp; Mastering experience, currently pursuing my career in 🌴 Los Angeles: pop music&#039;s hometown! 

YOU should consider me for your needs because I LISTEN 👂. I listen to the customer. I listen to all types of music. I listen to the minutest details in the work I produce to make sure we can fulfill projects with the thinnest margins for error. I WILL instill your project with the right amounts of creativity and passion.

If that&#039;s not convincing enough, read on...

Through playing classical piano since age 5 👶, I gained exposure to Music Theory, Ear Training, Live Performance, and Competitions. I am proud to be a 2x winner of the United States Open Music Competition [Treasury of Contemporary, Intermediate Level &#039;10; Senior Level &#039;13].

It went all downhill from there. (No, just kidding.)

I taught myself how to produce by spending all my time watching tutorials. The first 20 to 30 beats I ever made were . . . not very good . . . so let&#039;s not talk about that! 🗑️ But in 2016, in the middle of studying electrical engineering at UCLA, I decided to pursue a music artist career seriously. 

By deciding to leave UCLA, I doubled down on my passion by applying to the California College of Music in Pasadena, CA in 2019. There, I enrolled in the Certificate in Songwriting &amp; Music Production and learned all about Songwriting, Production, Composition, Mixing, Studio Equipment, Live Audio, etc. I graduated the program in March 2021!

One of the culminating projects for school was making our own EPs. The EP I made was a 3-track project inspired by Porter Robinson, Jaden Smith, and JuiceWRLD. It was self-composed, written, produced, mixed, and mastered. 

I am currently diving in headfirst into my solo music artist career. In the meantime, I hope to collide worlds with you and make as much stuff as we can together. Let&#039;s talk soon!

(TL;DR) - My strongest strengths are my LISTENING &amp; communication skills, attention to detail, emulation of popular styles, and experience working across a breadth of modern pop music genres.

165,Shawn L.,Kingston,Songwriter/Lyricist/Creative Writer/Music Producer/,"Here on Upwork I compose jingles and create web content, usually on the topic of music. I specialize in teaching songwriting, lyrics, and music theory. In my home studio I currently have over 40 instruments from autoharps to the theremin! I constantly find old and damaged instruments that I repair and learn to play. 

I am also an audiophile that collects reel to reel tapes, vinyl, and cassette. If you are on a game show for music trivia; you will want me on your team! That is why I can write about such a variety of topics like the ones in my portfolio. As a creative music nut I can bring an eccentric and unique perspective to your project!

In fact in my past Upwork projects you will see that I have produced songs, written T-shirt slogans, and provided voiceovers.

I previously managed a small recording studio in Ireland, were I accumulated 100&#039;s of working hours in developing and sharpening skills in audio recording and post-production. I learned just about everything from microphone placement, audio recording, mixing, mastering and producing. I was privileged to work with such amazing talent, producing records for Follow My Lead (Signed to Fearless Records), The Clameens (Signed to Gary Powel&#039;s label from the Libertines) and many, many more.  
​
Education-wise I studied music composition and interactive audio at University where I was awarded both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master Of Science Degree. (Nope. Not at the same time, it was over a period of years which added a few greys). 

Today, however, I primarily work as a Technical Sound Designer and Video Game Music Composer/Producer.  I deliver interactive scores by utilising popular Game Engines such as the Unreal Engine and Unity, and then integrating middleware such as WWISE or FMOD to make the most of today&#039;s technology in creating interactive audio.  I have worked on many games, most notable being Black Box VR and Guardians Of The Rose (PS4, Xbox &amp; Steam).

The best thing about it all, by using today&#039;s technology I am able to work from my home studio.  This makes me extremely flexible, easy to contact and exchange project files and deliver edits on the fly.

184,Kirill T.,Batumi,Advanced Vocal Production | Music Production | Mixing | Mastering,"15+ years of experience. One of Upwork&#039;s top 3% freelancers.
Frustrated that most producers always show the &quot;after&quot; and never the &quot;before&quot;? I&#039;ll show you both. I have an extensive portfolio with BEFORE vs AFTER examples showcasing my music production, vocal processing, audio editing, mixing and mastering skills.

♦️Mixing and Mastering♦️

I can mix and master anything to industry standards regardless of genre or style.
•	I will make your track sound just as loud, dense and bright as the rest of your playlist;
•	I will smooth out all the unpleasant frequencies so that everything blends in perfectly;
•	I will work on creating multiple sound dimensions within the song using various types of space and stereo processing;
•	I will make sure that all the elements are equally audible and have their own place in the mix.

♦️Advanced Vocal Production♦️
 
Have a good singing voice and decent recording equipment but your vocals never sound like what you hear in your favorite songs?

By using a combination of various advanced vocal mixing and editing techniques I can solve that problem. 
•	I can manually tune the vocals to make them sound exactly on pitch while still very natural (with Melodyne and Antares);
•	I can fix all the timing issues and make sure that all the vocal layers are perfectly aligned (with Revoice Pro);
•	I can do doubling (if you provide multiple takes) to make the vocals sound wide and rich.
•	I can make sure your vocals are crisp and stable in terms of volume and frequency spectrum (with EQ, multiband compression, limiting and saturation).
•	I can make your recording sound bigger, more life-like and multi-layered by applying different kinds of reverb and delay.
•	I can reduce excessive breath and sibilance.
 
While mixing vocals is tedious to most producers, it&#039;s oddly satisfying to me. This is why it&#039;s one of my strongest suits.
 
♦️Music Production♦️
 
Over the years of working as a freelancer I&#039;ve become quite versatile as a producer and have mastered the techniques needed to compose, arrange, produce and remix a whole variety of genres and styles from scratch, including:
 
•	All kinds of EDM - House (Slap House, Deep House, Future House, Progressive House, Electro House, Tropical House), Trance (Progressive Trance, Uplifting Trance), Midtempo, Bigroom, Future Bass;
•	Retro (Synthwave, Synthpop, Disco, Cyberpunk);
•	Chill (Lo-fi, Ambient, Meditation Music);
•	Acoustic (Piano, Cinematic, Trailer Music); 
•	Hip-hop, Trap;
•	Anything Pop.
I’ll make a track around your lyrics or melodies in any of these styles even if it&#039;s just a rough idea recorded on your phone.
I have music in my portfolio in all of these genres - just tell me if you&#039;re interested in hearing a particular style.

I&#039;ve used the skills listed above to make music and process various kinds of audio for music-related apps, businesses and my own creative projects. I&#039;ve ghost-produced for other artists, had my music released on record labels, and I’d be happy to help you translate your vision into a polished, competitive and radio-ready product as well.

**STANDARD CONTRACT TERMS/RULES OF ENGAGEMENT** 

Please be sure to review these basic terms prior to awarding a project: 

1. Unless otherwise stated in the proposal, one round of minor technical revisions is included on any project of less than 500 words, if needed (hissing, background noises, hum, etc). 

2. The revision policy does not apply to script changes. Script changes will incur additional an additional recording fee of 50% of the project budget (whether fixed price of hourly rate). 

3. Once a sample or demo is approved, the VO talent will record the project in-line with that sample or demo as close as possible. Requests for extreme tone changes after sample or demo approval are not covered under the revision policy. 

4. Any technical or speech errors will be immediately corrected free of charge and are not considered revisions. 

5. For projects less than 500 words, minor revisions of up to 500 words total are covered in the revision policy. 

Requests for revisions beyond 500 words will incur additional charges.

6. Hourly projects are per PRODUCTION HOUR, not finished.  A one hour minimum charge may apply for smaller projects.  This is subject to project review.

7. All projects subject to materials review prior to any commencement of the work.  I find myself putting placeholder bids on many projects due to lack of information, such as budget, length, deadline, audio format, file separation, usage rights, etc.  I like to avoid misunderstandings with projects, and this is the best to way to achieve that.  This applies to both fixed price and hourly projects.

8. All projects to be kept on the Upwork forum.  Hourly projects will be timed using the Upwork timing algorithm, per Upwork policies.

9. Script revisions I make or any script writing I perform is subject to additional charges, based on the script requirements.

10.  All scripts and pronunciation guides are the responsibility of the client.   VO will not make unpaid corrections for pronunciation errors that could have been handled prior to recording.  This especially applies to medical, technology, and financial scripts that may have difficult words or acronyms that need to be sounded out.  It is your responsibility to provide the pronunciation that is correct.

11.   I review all project details carefully.  Please do not solicit or entertain trying to lower my rates, it will not usually go anywhere.  I have no interest in low paying You Tube narration jobs that pay $10 for a 15 minute script.  This is my job, and it cost me time and money to produce work, the same as it does for you.  Please be mindful that you are considering and/or hired me for a skill set that is specialized, and should be treated as such.  I realize cost is a factor, but I am not going to invest time and other resources to make peanuts.

I&#039;m from sunny California where the people are creative, hard working and always on the move.

I&#039;m happiest when I&#039;m creating unique, epic content but I also like to open the doors to creativity and let the magic happen.

For me, the world is too full of people with a narrow vision. We need more free-spirited visionaries. This became crystal clear for me when I realized that too many settle for the first idea that comes around... I see so much &quot;just so-so&quot; voiceover and music in online content.. I noticed that people are in a hurry, rushing for the deadline; but sometimes quality takes a few tries. Some things require patience, revision and extra effort!

I had to do something about it. I decided to join teams with driven, inspired creatives who would like to join me in my passion for creating the best we can..

In the past, I set my sights and bar too low, undervaluing myself and attracting less-than-inspiring work, wasted a lot of time and effort, and got sidetracked by jobs that weren&#039;t right for me.. It hasn&#039;t been easy, but in the end I&#039;ve re-aligned my focus toward what sparks my creative passions..

Now my mission is to keep bringing stories and ideas to life with my voice and music..

Count on me to voice your script just as you like it. Count on me to bring your musical idea to fruition or completion. I am a multi-instrumentalist composer, songwriter and producer. Saxophone, piano, guitar, accordion, flute, synth and DAW programming, vocals, voiceover and videos.

230,Tom A.,Sparta,"Voiceover, eLearning, Audiobook - Audio Narrator and Producer","&quot;The narration is top notch.  This is the first time I&#039;ve ever heard Tom Askin as a narrator and he does excellent job.  He hits all the right notes and gets you really emotionally invested in the story and the characters.  He gets you to really feel for these characters, especially the weight in the gravitas of everything this doctor feels and goes through to save people during these events.&quot;

&quot;Tom Askin is absolutely the perfect narrator for this story. I can’t imagine anyone else voicing Dr. Ethan King.&quot;

&quot;Choosing Tom Askin for the narrator of this book was brilliant. His voice (which voice can be make or break it for me when it comes to audiobooks) is perfect and exactly how I would imagine Dr. King&#039;s voice to sound. &quot;

&quot;The narrator did a fantastic job bringing life to the characters and making them 3 dimensional. You could feel the pain and horror the characters were experiencing.&quot;

&quot;The narrator truly does an excellent job of drawing you into the story, making you care about the characters and actually feel the powerful emotions.&quot;

&quot;The narrator does a fantastic job of emitting the thoughts, emotions and his characters are real enough to be believed.&quot;

With 25 years in the audio field, I am the Chief Engineer at PonderRosa Studios, a retreat recording studio 50 miles west of NYC.

Starting as a producer/guitar player years ago, I have since completed a degree in audio, gained certifications and expertise in Pro Tools, Logic Pro and Audition, as well as earned credits as a mix engineer.

As an audio editor I can quickly assist you with removing that unwanted noise, stutters, repetition, or crutch words (such as “um’s,” &quot;like,&quot; &quot;kinda,&quot; &quot;sorta,&quot; etc.) from your recordings. I will also  add your selected music, sound design, and deliver a fully mixed and mastered audio render; adding polish using advanced post-production tools/techniques, and exporting your deliverables at the appropriate loudness standards for the platform(s) you plan to upload to.

With a degree in audio and many years of audio editing experience, I have worked on a variety of projects: podcast editing, live band recording, game soundtracks, artist collaborations, and many other projects. In order to maintain a quality and efficient workflow, I have templates within my DAW ready for the editing and mixing of many genres of music or dialogue.

(Feel free to book a free consultation and discovery call with me: calendly.com/davevisaya)

As an aspiring musician, I&#039;ve been playing around with audio production since 2009. It must have been fate that I landed a job at the best website for real estate investors (BiggerPockets), which happens to have a podcast. It was inevitable that I&#039;ll be editing their podcast. The rest is history. Now, I have helped over 150 podcasters launch their shows and I&#039;m looking forward to helping more!

After editing hundreds of podcast episodes and producing a couple of ones, I discovered that podcasting is more than just editing out the awkward pauses and annoying noises. It is also about making sure the listeners get to clearly understand the message and have a superb experience at the same time!

Quite a number of podcasters and guests may not notice this but they can sound different on the recordings—to the point where they can come across as unprepared or unconfident. I believe this can be minimized or controlled at a certain level with good editing and audio engineering skills.

With over 7 years of podcast editing and production experience under my belt, I can now easily spot the difference between shows that excel and shows that do not. I believe any show can be amazing provided all the essentials are taken care of accordingly.

The idea was simple: turn every podcast from ordinary to amazing by making sure all the important bases are covered. In essence, that’s how we came to be—your best resource when it comes to your podcast editing needs!

But hey, talk is cheap. That being said, you might as well take advantage of our free trial so you can see what we can do for you.

One thing is certain: we won’t disappoint.

Tools I use:
Garageband, Logic Pro X, Screenflow, iMovie, Adobe Audition, Rx 5, Wordpress, Canva, Photoshop

I&#039;ve also been a guest on some podcasts: Simplewholesaling Podcast Episode 25, 3rd World Startup Episode 10, and 12 Minute Convos.

I’ve also produced and published podcasts like Marketing in Yoga Pants, Growth Marketing Today, Simplewholesaling, PassportJoy, and much more!

283,Don K.,Nashville,"Audio Production, Mixing, Beat Creation, and Multi-Instrumentalist","I have been producing music since 2013. Since then I have expanded my production skills to include full service; recording, writing, mixing. My education allowed me to deeper my skills in the studio, and also branch out in genre&#039;s produced. 

Currently I produce a wide array of genres, and can do pretty much anything but my some of my favorites are; Alternative RnB, Indie, Indie Pop, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop, House. 

I grew up in a musical household, playing any instrument I could find, and that has translated well into my music production giving me the ability to play on the records I produce. I am most proficient in piano and guitar, and along with my freelance production I have also played synths and piano on records. 

As far as the jobs I can do, I have produced tracks ranging from all acoustic instruments tracking live in the studio, to beats created in the computer with heavy synthesis and 808s. I am fully proficient in Pro Tools, Logic Pro, and Ableton though I often lean in on Ableton in my daily music creation process.  I have worked with Night Beds, Landry, and C.S. Fulp amongst other artists I am currently in works with. 

I am excited to help you out with your creative project any way I can. &amp; if you have any questions please let me know!","           29,097.11",704,               41.30,0,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~012b08b5fe46a3077b/)

297,Michael A G.,Jackson Township,"AudioBook Editor, tons of audio, commercial/ACX narration exp.","Hi all, 
I have Narrated, edited, mastered and produced literally hundreds of audio books for Audible/ACX...Additionally, I&#039;ve also done audio work for many projects, including other (Non-Audible Related) audio books, podcast intros / corporate and commercial media audio .... so, yes I have experience doing this stuff!
Also I have solely edited lots of audio for companies and individuals.
The $50.. per hour price is 50 PFH (per finished hour for narration) which typically only relates to Audio-Books, in other words, if your audio book is three hours (about 30,000 words) then it would cost a total of $150 for the project, even though it takes longer than that to record edit and master the project.
The bottom line, is that when it comes to audio book work, you usually know exactly how much it will cost in advance.If you have recorded the Audio-book yourself, the price can vary widely depending on the recorded quality and what must be done to bring it into conformity.

PLEASE NOTE: Any hourly work that runs over 20 hours automatically gets its hourly rate reduced by 20%.

Prices for SHORT-FORM narration vary by project due to the many variables, music track etc...
Just contact me so we can discuss exact pricing... it will be reasonable!
In other words &quot;EVERYTHING is NEGOTIABLE!&quot;
All audio was recorded and mastered by me, using my studio which utilizes professional-grade gear.

299,Elaine K.,Lexington,Podcast Editor and Voiceover Artist,"My goal is to help you clearly communicate your message, free of errors and distractions, so that all your listeners hear is a polished, professional recording!

-Content Editing
I listen to your content, keep the most important parts, and cut parts that are excessive or repetitive, so that your episodes fit into an allotted timeframe.  Not every editor is willing or has the ability to do this.

-Removing Mistakes
I edit your podcast episodes for conciseness (removing excessive &quot;um&#039;s,&quot; &quot;you knows,&quot; repetitive words, and foibles).  I splice words and sentences and put them back together again seamlessly so that your audience won&#039;t be able to tell you made a mistake.  I also take out long pauses to keep your conversation flowing smoothly.

-Noise Reduction &amp; Sound Improvement
I remove distracting background noise, hiss, pops, clicks, mic bumps, and loud breaths.  I also eliminate certain frequencies, like sirens and cell phone chirps. I reduce Zoom call artifacts and delays.  And I minimize echo to help live events sounds more like they were recorded in a regular room instead of on a stage.  

-Mixing &amp; Mastering
I mix your recording with your intro, outro, and sponsorship ads in the Adobe Audition multitrack editor.  I level out the volume of yours and your guests&#039; voices, and add equalization and compression for a broadcast quality sound. 

-Intro/Outro Creation and Sponsorship Ads
I am an American voice talent, with 35 &quot;five star&quot; ratings on Voices.com.  I have also recorded 11 audiobooks that are for sale on audible.com.  I can write and record your podcast intro and outro and choose music to make them stand out and get listener attention!

-Audiogram Creation
An audiogram is a short video representation of your podcast that you can share on social media!  You choose a clip from one of your episodes that you would like to share, and I will add captions, along with an animated waveform that you can post on your favorite sites! This is a great way to get your audience excited about your upcoming episodes!

-Podcast Cover Art
I can design podcast cover art that fits the vibe of your podcast that you can upload to iTunes to make your podcast stand out from the crowd!

I graduated from Shoreline College with a 4.0 in Digital Audio Engineering as well as a degree in Music Business.  I also graduated Summa cum Laude from the University of Colorado with a BS in Music. 

I&#039;ve mentored with Paul Robb of Think Tank and and internationally known, platinum selling recording artists Information Society.  I&#039;ve held a residency at Seattle&#039;s historic Soundhouse Studios with Jack Endino (Nirvana, Soundgarden) and Steve Fisk. And I continue to grow and learn from my peers, professors, and experts in the field of audio engineering.

I have worked as a producer and performer for the entire sound replacement of a feature film.  This included finding and hiring voice actors, editing audio, foley performances, score supervision, and voice acting myself.

Recently, I was the sound editor for a feature length documentary (Klocked) that is currently making the festival circuit.  It has already won two awards and is being invited to many more domestic and international film festivals.

I&#039;ve recorded several albums for artists with one of them reaching to #2 in sales in the Seattle area.  I have recently completed two new albums in the Denver area for local artists that are about to launch.

In Seattle, I ran, edited, and produced a podcast for Shoreline College.  The podcast started as a local artist spotlight with interviews and live in-studio performances.  This branched out into a podcast for the entire college regarding performances outside of the recording department, live ensemble shows on location, and interviews with staff and faculty.

I have been editing and producing audio since the early 2000s with a formal education following just a few years later.  I have interned at two recording studios in Seattle and Denver.  I am a member of two different honor societies, the recoding academy of arts and sciences, and the national audio engineering society.","           27,421.26",784,               34.96,10,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~0180f707002d8f65c5/)

321,James K.,Cicero,"Producer, Creative Consultant, Former Full Stack Developer","I&#039;ve always been someone who likes to experiment, learn new things, and look beyond traditional beliefs and assumptions. For example, In grade school, my teacher gave us an assignment to read a novel and write a summary. I asked if I could write a piece of music inspired by the book instead, and to my surprise, she said yes!

I picked Bram Stoker&#039;s Dracula, which is still one of my favorite books to this day. After reading it, I sat down at our family piano and started composing. My objective was to capture the eerie feel of the Transylvanian countryside and the ominous silhouette of the Count&#039;s castle against a dark blue sky through the eyes of the lead character, Jonathan Harker, as he approached in his stagecoach. The result was a two-page solo piano piece with a haunting melody and some fancy finger work. I even calligraphed the title in a Gregorian-style handwriting at the top of the page. My teacher gave me an A+ for creativity.

These days, I&#039;m still all about trying new things that challenge the boundaries of established beliefs, whether utilizing my skills in digital design, writing catchy scripts for videos and ads, capturing location sound for films, coding websites and apps, or learning something entirely new. And, despite having a robust and diverse creative skillset, I also excel in mathematics and logistics. My experience in composing intricate musical pieces, building websites and games, building and managing web servers, and running small businesses has equipped me with proficiencies in engineering and project management. I find satisfaction in blending my imaginative and analytical abilities to achieve success.

When I&#039;m not working, you can usually find me tinkering around with personal projects like using decision matrices to pick dinner spots with my wife, organizing my ideas in Trello, keeping track of our finances with spreadsheets, or building new furniture for my home or office. I also love going for walks with my wife and dog, and biking around the city.

If you&#039;re looking for someone who is passionate, creative, and always eager to take on new challenges, I&#039;d love to chat. Check out my portfolio below and let&#039;s grab a virtual coffee sometime.

I&#039;m a professional producer, director, scriptwriter, storyteller, video editor, motion graphics &amp; graphic designer, videographer, photographer, as well as a musician, sound designer, mixer &amp; voice talent.

I&#039;m also well versed in YouTube (add other platforms) channel design/video search optimization, SEO/SEM &amp; other innovative video marketing strategies. Social Media posting &amp; advertising standards, best practices, etc. - based on the platform.

ABOUT
Tom has a background in television, feature films, emerging technologies, marketing, and business development.

In 1991, Tom discovered Northeastern&#039;s television studio while studying Communication at Northeastern University. Adding a concentration in television and film to his studies, Tom spent many days (and nights) mastering all the equipment in the studio.

Late in 1991, the studio installed an Avid Media Composer digital editing system, a brand new technology. Tom immediately saw it as the future and became proficient with the system. Over the next two years, Avid took the video world by storm.

Referred and championed by his Northeastern professor&#039;s Tom was hired by Reebok (freelance) to assist and train the in-house video department on the Avid editing system. Reebok was gearing up for the Super Bowl XXVI launch of the tragically flawed, &quot;Dan vs. Dave&quot; multi-million dollar advertising campaign. The campaign was designed to generate buzz between two American decathletes: Dan O&#039;Brien and Dave Johnson - for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Both were considered &quot;sure locks&quot; for gold and silver medals. The campaign took a tragic turn when Dan failed to qualify for the games. It was a great learning experience for a young college student. Tom also realized the corporate world was not for him.

In 1993, again referred by his professors, Tom was hired by an independent production company to apply his skills with the Avid Media Composer for a PBS documentary. By the time the documentary was finished Tom was also responsible for field sound recording and he composed the music for the production. The documentary - Sex Education In America: AIDS and Adolescence - received critical acclaim after a congressional viewing with the Surgeon General of the United States of America.

In 1994, Tom moved to Los Angeles to join a start-up Avid editing system provider for feature films. This was at the dawn of the digital editing era when Hollywood made the move from traditional film-based editing to digital editing. Tom spent countless hours in the cutting rooms (editing rooms) supporting the systems and working with many Academy Award-winning, producers, directors and editors. Some of the films Tom worked on include: As Good As It Gets, Jackie Brown, Mulholland Drive, Titanic and Waiting for Guffman.

In 1999, Tom founded Orbit Digital West in Santa Monica. The company was a subsidiary of start-up Orbit Digital, in New York. Tom partnered with Orbit Digital to give the company a bi-coastal presence and to target the feature film market in Los Angeles. Tom glided into sales, marketing, emerging technologies, and a business development role. Within a year the company was a &quot;powerhouse&quot; providing systems to all the major studios and production companies, including Miramax Films, Revolution Studios, Universal Studios, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros. The company experienced rapid and exponential growth during Tom&#039;s time at the company. The company was sold in 2004 to PostWorks; a New York based post-production facility.

In 2006, Tom moved back to Lexington, Massachusetts to seek treatment and be close to family while recovering from complications related to a serious mountain biking accident in Malibu, California.

In 2009, Tom moved to Martha&#039;s Vineyard and began doing freelance creative work. He is a skilled: web and graphic designer, photographer, video producer, and musician. During this time he also focused on the trends and technology related to video, internet, social media, marketing and the principles of search engine optimization (SEO).

On a final note, Tom&#039;s entrepreneurial spirit and experience in building a successful business from the ground up enables him to understand that your success is tied to his success. He is committed to building long-term, fruitful relationships with his clientele.

340,Zlatko A.,Pancevo,Podcast Audio Editor - Product Photo Editor,"★ Top Rated ★

Let me introduce myself briefly: I am a very dedicated, responsible, precise, detail-oriented and proactive worker. I own a broad spectrum of working experience, ranging from audio editing, photo editing, podcast mastering, and editing, across music creation, intro recording, jingle music to voice over services.

-Remove Mistakes
I can edit your podcast episodes for conciseness (removing excessive &quot;um&#039;s,&quot; &quot;you knows,&quot; repetitive words, and foibles).  I can splice words and sentences and put them back together again seamlessly so that your audience won&#039;t be able to tell you made a mistake.  I can also take out long pauses to keep your conversation flowing smoothly.

-Noise Reduction &amp; Sound Improvement
I can remove distracting background noise, hiss, pops, clicks, mic bumps, and loud breaths.  I can level out the volume of you and your guests&#039; voices.  I can then add equalization and compression for a broadcast quality sound.

-Mixing &amp; Mastering
I can mix your recording with your intro, outro, and sponsorship ads in the Adobe Audition multitrack editor, normalize your audio to broadcast standard, and upload your files to a hosting service or email your mp3 or wav files.

-Intro/Outro Creation
I can create and mix Intro and Outro for your podcast show. 

If you need any/all of the following - then I might be just the right fit for you:

✔ Audio Editing
✔ Audio Mixing
✔ Audio repair (noise, clicks, pops, hum, buzz, distortion, rumbling, microphone handling, phase shifting, echo reduction)
✔ Audio post-production for film and tv
✔ Voice-over recording and editing 
✔ Virtual Assistance
✔ Photo Editing
✔ Podcasts, interviews, seminars editing and post-production
✔ Music Composing
✔ Photography/Editor

More about me 
-------------------------------- 
I am an Audio Engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal, where I  run a successful audio studio. 
 
As a student, I earned a degree in Electrical Engineering. Then, I taught Math and Physics for a while, but when I started teaching Audio Production in a school in Lisbon, I became hooked on audio forever! I have now taught Music Production and Audio Production in educational institutions for over 15 years. 
 
In addition to my academic background, I&#039;ve always been connected to show business, through music, radio, and the performing arts. I was even a radio host for more than ten years! This is one of the main reasons why I love helping others improve their podcast so much. 

When I am not teaching or editing audio, you can find me at the gym, soaking in the sun at the beach, experimenting with electronics (I am a big fan of domotics), or playing with my daughter in the park.

I’ve worked with startups, long-established brands, non-profits, authors, publishers, printers, and web development teams. I’ve had the privilege to work for individuals with a story to tell and organizations with a product to sell or a mission to share.

My approach to design varies, just as the type of projects I work on can vary. In general, my designs are specifically created to stand out in the world of visual overwhelm. I like to think that sometimes this is achieved with stunning simplicity, sometimes with beautiful complexity, but really it is done by listening to clients, developing an understanding of the audience, and being very  clear about the messages the design needs to convey. 

I’m well-versed in identity design and brand strategy, typography, graphic design, book &amp; document design / layout, and even audio design. I can manage projects from the initial idea through to their completion. I have significant experience with complex, multi-faceted projects that involve multiple skillsets, and I have no trouble switching between those skills or employing several at once.

For the past 5 years, I have been working as a freelancing Video Editor and Photo Album designer.

I specialize in Business spotlight and promos, Short video editing, Wedding Highlights, Wedding Cinematic, Music Video Album editing, Travel videos and short film (documentary) editing. 

My strength is my creativity and ability to visualize the end result when looking at the raw footage. I work my way to achieve this end result. I value customer opinion, and I am open to make adjustments to satisfy the customer needs.

I give my 100% commitment to every project I take. I feel satisfied only when my customer is satisfied, and when he gets what he wanted. I also believe strongly in Work-Life balance, and therefore, I try to limit my work to 30 Hrs per week.

375,Andrew S.,Kyiv,"Colorist, editor, and DI","With over 20 years of experience in editing and more than 15 years in color grading, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects in the film and TV industry.
In 1998 I started working as a news editor at a small regional TV station, and have since worked at several national TV stations, production, and post-production companies in Ukraine. I collaborated with directors and cinematographers from all over the world on a wide variety of projects, from TV commercials to feature films.

To have some scope you can check my IMDb profile (nm2185355).
 
I&#039;m a DaVinci Resolve expert and also have experience with Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. I can handle all aspects of post-production, from basic DI to building the narrative and finishing with studio-quality grading, titles, and clean sound. I&#039;m also comfortable working on VFX projects, with experience in rotoscoping, match moving, and logo removal or replacement.

What sets me apart is my ability to work closely with clients to ensure that their needs are met. I&#039;m always happy to consult with clients during the pre-production stage to help them build a cost-effective pipeline and get the most out of their equipment. And during post-production, I work fast and independently to deliver the exact result my clients are looking for.

If you&#039;re looking for an experienced editor and colorist who is easy to work with and committed to delivering top-notch results, please don&#039;t hesitate to get in touch.

Hello, thanks for visiting my profile!  Here is a basic outline of my skills and experience:                                                 


                                                      VIDEO PRODUCTION, DESIGN,
                                         ANIMATION (2D/2.5D/3D/Augmented Reality),
                             
I have an Envato Elements account for stock images, video, music, and sound fx:

My primary video editing/2D animation software programs are Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects, of which AE is now integrated and partnering with Maxon&#039;s Cinema 4D, my 3D software. I am also highly proficient in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator where I do design work and graphics prep for video productions.  For quality live screen capturing, I produce in OBS Studio and Camtasia software.

                                                            AUDIO PRODUCTION:

I am a lifelong musician (5 instruments), composer, and sound engineer and have been producing in Adobe Audition since it was still &quot;Cool Edit Pro&quot; in 2003. These productions include original music,  gaming sound,  genuine foley sound effects, full soundtrack productions, voiceovers, podcasts, children&#039;s stories, and many others. 

                                                                     OTHER SKILLS:

My most vital skill is the conceptualization and ideation process itself, and It gives me such an interest in video production, animation, and music.  I am particularly great at taking disparate concepts and bringing them together into a cohesive flow to explain a concept or tell a story. 

I earned a Bachelor&#039;s degree in philosophy from the University of North Florida and I have highly developed analytical and writing skills that I am constantly utilizing to help my clients with their writing needs.  I am frequently called on to manage scriptwriting, storyboards, copywriting, editing, presentations, and more in my work.   

                                 LOCATION AND AVAILABILITY:

I live in Jacksonville, Florida (-5GMT) where I launched Avalon Studios about ten years ago.  I work as a single contractor/business owner but have frequently hired and successfully managed multiple contractors for large projects. As such, I can manage and produce larger contracts with trusted and proven contractors at my side.  My availability is flexible and generous, so when needed, I am willing to accommodate any time zone and schedule.  

Contract-wise, I enjoy doing various kinds of individual projects. Still, I am particularly interested in developing more long-term relationships in more specific contexts with individuals and organizations I resonate. 


                                             ****************

I first began studying English Language and Writing at GCSE level which I received an A* in, in addition to 9 other A* to B grades. I then studied Philosophy, Music and Computing at Queen Mary&#039;s College which helped bring my academic side out in addition to familiarizing myself with advanced technology for written work and research. 

After graduating from this college, I attended De Montfort University for three years studying Music, Technology and Innovation. This course was very heavy on the written work side of things, resulting in my efficiency and speed of writing increasing rapidly in addition to my skills in formal writing, presentation and imagery. 

After graduating with a First Class Honours, I became a Researcher at the same university, being given the task to write a 20,000 research paper on algorithmic music. After defending my research in a Viva, my research paper was submitted to The British Library. Ever since submission, I have continued to pursue a career in writing, and have began working as an SEO Copywriter for a vast range of tech startups, ECommerce markets and companies.

424,Brian R.,Blaine,Video Production,"Hello!

I am a Video Editor and Audio Producer with 11+ years of experience in the field. I have completed projects for companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Tedx, Yelp, Spacex, and more. I have a wide range of experience spanning from video editing, graphic design, photography, live stage production and music production.

My communication skills are the reason I can deliver products that accomplish the message you are trying to convey. I make every project personal to me because at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is your message.

I work in a process that guides the both of us to your final product:

Outline:
We discuss the main idea of your project. We agree on the style and “look” you want to achieve. We review examples or similar projects that have elements you like. We review what elements need to be created and a timeline for an initial draft.

Draft:
I will organize a draft of the video, sound, music, photos, animations or titles that will encompass your main idea and the core elements that were discussed in the outline. This will serve as a storyboard for your ideas and can serve as a great point to re-evaluate your message and how you want it portrayed. 

First cut:
A high quality version of all elements put together that will closely resemble your final product. This will include high resolution renders of animations or titles. As well as sound mixing, music mixing and sound effects.

Mastering:
This is where the polishing begins with color correction and sound mastering. The final rendering of your product with all of the quality settings “cranked up to 11”.

Delivery:
Multiple versions are rendered for different uses and any separate elements divided and rendered. 

I am always available for questions and discussions of anything you need. 100% customer satisfaction is my goal, and I am not happy until you are happy.","           80,917.28",2213,               36.56,15,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01f67da1c5da71ce67/)

Hello, and thank you for visiting my Upwork profile, here is a quick outline of my skills and talents. I am a native German with near-native English proficiency and excellent written and verbal skills in both languages and 26 years of experience as an English to German translator/proofreader. I do quality and accurate translations of English Educational/IT/Marketing/E-Commerce and other material into German and deliver a quick turnaround. I have a keen sense of translation, Word choice, sentence structure, punctuation, grammar, etc. and my forte is to make sure that my translations sound like natural German. 

Currently I am translating a monthly Newsletter for Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, WA (since July 2020), and since May 2020 I am translating daily stock market news for the Spanish translation agency IPT-Translations.

**Voice-Over Recordings**
Aside from translations I also do voice-over recordings in studio quality for language audiobooks, sales &amp; &#039;How-To&#039; videos, IVR Phone recordings, kidz-apps, travel guides, explainer videos and YouTube tutorials, etc., in German and in English. I use the Samson Q1U Dynamic Microphone in a soundproofed environment (acoustic foam, studio set up). Likewise, I am also experienced in timing audios and syncing them to original videos and slideshows.

**Highlights of my History as a Linguist**
From June 2020 to May 2022 I translated video subtitles and captions for the American company Rev (rev.com), which amounted to 3500 minutes of video material and earnings of $10,200 for a total of 360 videos, using their in-house Atlas video editor. The majority were sales, marketing &amp; e-commerce videos, as well as product videos for corporations such as Yamaha, Fender, D&#039;Addario, Lumisoft, Hitachi, Canon, Amazon Music, Hines and Schenker. I also translated TEDx Talks and Ed Sullivan Shows featuring Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes, Ella Fitzgerald and the Four Tops, which included translating the song lyrics.

From April 2017 to August 2019 I translated ca. 600 quizzes for Howstuffworks.com from English to German, the topics ranging from music, movies, the 80s, cars, how to fix cars, personality quizzes, math &amp; science quizzes, general knowledge, history, geography to many other subjects. Because my client&#039;s business needs changed, he ended the contract in August 2019.

From 2014 until 2017 I was focusing on doing voice-overs for many clients and companies from all over the world and was taking care of the translations part for some of them as well.

In 2013 I was busy working for the Marvel Comics Group via Language Connect, UK to translate comic book back issues (1968s - present) of Spider-Man, Avengers, X-Men, Iron Man, Thor and many other superheroes. 

From 1998 to 2012  I was co-heading the English-German translations desk for the publishing companies Aurora Productions, CH and Activated Desk, UK, all the while working in an English speaking micro-environment. In this position my focus was on translations from the ground up, proofreading and quality control. I was also overseeing and training a group of remote translators and facilitated and proofread their work. The majority of the material has been on the topics of personal development, coaching &amp; training, and on religion &amp; spirituality. To further underscore my proficiency and language awareness: I hold a degree as a TEFL-Teacher (teaching English as a foreign language); I am a certified Life-Coach as well and coach clients in both languages.

454,Mark W.,Marietta,Top-notch Writer &amp; Translator on demand,"Need someone to best convey the tone of your English across to the other side and receive accurate feedback from the Chinese counterpart, and vice versa? Or do you need a published writer to help hone your skills? Someone with business understanding to help you unleash your brainchild into the world or introduce your products into the marketplace?

I can HELP you,  and EFFECTIVELY at that!


BILINGUAL TRANSLATION

I am Mark W., based in the United States of America. With almost 40 years&#039; experience under my belt of bilingual writing, translating, interpreting, editing, etc., I had been a reporter for seven years and had various stints at law firms to secure case approvals from U.S. federal government agencies through extensive documentation and rebuttals. Ethnic marketing for businesses and cultural events is also my forte since I am well-versed in Chinese and English while being well-rounded across different fields. On a side note, I was once interviewed by Dan Rather of CBS. Not that I love name-dropping, but that you have the right to know.


LINGUISTIC NERDINESS

With a long career behind me of bilingual writing across genres, I realized early on that, similar in grammatical structure, both Chinese and English have homonyms and synonyms.

But unlike the mostly flat English pronunciation, Chinese characters, mostly distinct from one another, in a varying number of strokes with each carrying a specific tone, sound like music while being strung along in pronunciation.

The two tongues will then rejoin at the proverbial hip as far as the connotation is concerned.

Identical characters may pronounce differently and have different shades of meaning depending on where &amp; how they are said &amp; written in a given situation,  which is still just an appetizer to the entire course of Chinese linguistic cuisine.

In comparison, English has its own quirks. Some combo words, belched out low and slow, and spelled out in uppercases with  exclamation marks, may sound or look so off base against their respective meanings in the dictionary that collectively they become their antonyms, e.g., Prof.: Positive plus positive must be positives. Student: YEAH! RIGHT!

These are only some of the points to ponder while doing back-and-forth translations, reflecting just one area of my expertise.


BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Aside from being a trained journalist, translator, interpreter, I am also a marketing specialist, good at most copy or content writings for specific projects, and for most writing jobs in general, be it for reviews, critiques, academic work, market research, and creative writing. Putting money where the mouth is, I used to take deep dives (figuratively speaking),  getting hands dirty by running a variety of businesses myself, such as a bookstore, restaurant, health clinic, in addition to my work in law firms and retail establishments. 

Having also been deeply rooted in merchandising arena for the past couple of decades, I keenly discern a massive array of commercial know-hows and linguistic tools for products&#039; differentiations, and know the power of a memorable tagline and description for moving the right products down to the POS. I can use different formats and tools, such as video subtitles and/or audio recordings to help people who want to increase online visibility and viability. 


NEITHER THE SKY NOR MIND IS THE LIMIT

With a motto of chasing limitless dreams out of a limited life experience and with a much fuller exposure to almost all aspects of academic, business, or mundane matters, I don&#039;t miss much.

Armed with such a mindset at work and with an arsenal of linguistic ammo at my disposal, I am confident that, given a chance, I am capable of turning a project into a promise made and promise kept.

Try me, and you will like me.

476,Riki U.,Cranbrook,"Illustrator, Writer, Video Editor and Voiceover Talent","Hello! 
Let me tell you a little about my areas of expertise:

ILLUSTRATION
I&#039;m an illustrator focusing on a digital painting style that is of a dreamy and magical nature. I love to create endearing scenes and characters that draw you in with curiosity to know more. The best example of my work can be found in my children&#039;s book series Spiral Fairy Tales.

VOICEOVER
I love altering my voice to create a unique sound for different projects. I have read children&#039;s books in a child&#039;s voice, narrated adult audiobooks, been the voice to many YouTube videos and even lent my voice to an educational course. I would love to craft the perfect sound for you.
I also have audio engineering experience so I can deliver ready to publish audio clips.

WRITING
I have loved to write ever since I was a child. That love for the written word is noticeable in my work. Weaving words to create a story or impression is something I live to do. I can write on almost any subject so feel free to throw something new at me. I love learning about new subjects and writing is the best way to do that. 

VIDEO EDITING
I have been editing videos for clients for a few years now and I love doing it. I enjoy taking raw footage and creating something fun and exciting for people to view. I make YouTube videos, client testimonials, product ads, music videos and anything else you can imagine. 

When I am creating, I try to get as good a &#039;feel&#039; as possible for a project so that I can do my best to capture its originality and bring forth the entire story it is trying to tell. When I am hired to create a piece, I put all of my creative energy into it. I value the opportunity you are giving me by choosing me to bring your vision to life. I do not take that lightly and will not rest until what I have created makes your heart happy. This is my promise to you.

The Process of Creating a Professional Video:
As a videographer, I specialize in creating high-quality videos with a quick turnaround. I focus heavily on pre-production to get the vision of the story focused before shoot day. After we have the story locked in it is time for production. On set, we will create a cinematic atmosphere by shaping and directing lights, recording multiple sources of audio to make sure everyone&#039;s voice is heard, and of course, capturing it all in high-quality 4k footage. Once we wrap up shoot day, it is time for post-production editing. Depending on the scope and scale of the project, I can have videos turned around as fast as twenty-four hours after the shoot. I implement logos, motion graphics, royalty-free music, sound effects, and strategic cuts to make your video clear and cohesive.

My name is Filip and I&#039;m a video editor and content creator with over 6 years of experience in the industry.

Throughout my career, I&#039;ve been lucky to work on a variety of high-profile projects including 7 figure TV shows, music videos, as well as in marketing sectors with social media content in focus.

These days I&#039;m mainly focused on online video content. As the world is turning more and more towards short forms and storytelling video formats, I too am following the trend and diving into short, personality or story-driven formats.  

Some of my dear clients I worked and still work with for many years:

👉Swiss Startup called HuggyStudio - in the role of a video(and podcast) editor with a focus on different social media platforms. 

👉SummaUp (UW Client) - Focused on editing testimonials, VSLs, as well as FB/IG Ads from time to time, using stock footage to enhance the quality.

👉Chris (UW Client) -  Making simple video-recorded testimonials into a short-form storytelling masterpiece for social media platforms, using stock footage and other editing techniques to enhance the quality.


Besides video editing, I also possess skills in motion graphics, colour grading and advanced audio editing. Also, I am good at storytelling and coming up with new ideas for content creation, so if you need to brainstorm some ideas or a new pair of eyes to review some of the current ideas you have, I can help you as well. 

Some of the projects I&#039;ve worked on in the past:

⚫ Music TV show &quot;STUDIO&quot;
Lead video editor on a TV show for the largest National TV station in Serbia, broadcasting at primetime. The show included over 40 music celebrities with over 80 music performances. I was in charge of the whole post-production pipeline editing-delivery process. Editing the music performances and coordinating two other video editors, director, sound editor, and producer, making sure the show always gets delivered on time.

⚫Novi Sad 2022: European Capital of Culture
For 3 years I&#039;ve been working as a social media video editor for one of the largest cultural projects in my home city. Editing hundreds of event videos, music performances, cultural events, panel discussions, interviews, etc. In this process, I generated a huge amount of experience when it comes to communication with the Marketing team as well as production teams on the field.

 ⚫Film festival &quot;Obnova&quot;
Started as a passion project with a friend, and turned into a huge event that&#039;s been going on for 3 years now. Here I&#039;m in the roles of Co-Founder and COO. With a team of over 50 people involved in the event production, this role has thought me a lot about leadership and how to take the steering wheel when it needs to be. Experience in leading the team proved to be more than welcome in the post-production pipelines in every project I worked on so far. 
 
Listening to instructions, taking and giving suggestions, being reliable and organized, bringing new ideas to the table, and delivering final products on time every time is just some of the descriptions I&#039;ve received from clients whom I worked with in the past.

If you&#039;re ready and want to work with a reliable video editor that can make things shiny and new, contact me now! I will make sure to respond to you within an hour (hopefully in just a few minutes).

😫 There&#039;s no denying that editing videos can be often exhausting. If you had the chance to do it by yourself then you know that endless hours are being spent on Organizing your files, Making cuts, Color correction, Fixing audio, Adding texts, Transitions, Creating graphics, Adding music, and the list can go on...

🧩 But it&#039;s an essential process that cannot be neglected, since here&#039;s where your vision is transformed in reality, where all pieces come together into an unique video that shares your story, ideas, and message in a compelling and creative way.

🕑 I understand how time consuming and complicated this can be at times, it feels truly draining and annoying, especially when you want to invest your time on duties that are more important to you and your business.

🤔 So, imagine finally releasing the overwhelming pressure of having to go through your video and make edits, or maybe just not having to worry about editing videos and just doing the important side of your business!

✅ Well, it can absolutely be done. If you are having these problems and would like to fix them, feel free to contact me, and I will be happy to discuss with you how we can work together to ACHIEVE your personal / business goals!

📝 Here&#039;s a list of projects I can help you with:

492,Jason C.,Seattle,Wordpress Guru and PHP Developer Extraordinaire,"Hey, My name is Jason!

I&#039;m a spirited PHP programmer and software engineer with a broad spectrum of talents. I&#039;ve spent half of my life coding in some capacity or another, but most of my focus and energy in the last 12 years has been on web development for the Wordpress framework, both front-end and back-end.

The non-nerd TL;DR
----
If you&#039;re a small business looking for an experienced developer with a proven track record for the Wordpress platform, then you&#039;ve probably come to the right place.

I&#039;ve built up and torn down enough Wordpress sites at this point that I would safely use the &quot;e&quot; word - expert. I know the pitfalls, &#039;gotchas&#039;, and nuanced behaviors in Wordpress that only comes from long and committed experience with the platform.

Whether it&#039;s site migration, custom plugin creation, or theme development, I can get you where you need to go.


The Juicy Parts
----
Most of my work has been development for Wordpress. I&#039;m an experienced developer for plugins and themes on the Wordpress platform and a competent back-end developer and server administrator. I build highly-available, resilient and secure distributed website applications.

Preferred Work
- **Implementing New Website Features** - I love system design! I love planning the data structure, building out system requirements, and implementing the final solution!
- **Front-end Design and Creative** - I love UX/UI design and am a competent Figma user. I can design, slice and implement my own designs, or one that you provide.
- **Large Projects** - I prefer longer contracts with lots of different kinds of tasks. Tiny contracts or monotonous work don&#039;t really appeal to.
- **Maintenance/On-call Retainers** - My services are available on retainer. This means that I can handle your site&#039;s issues as they crop up, without having to find a developer every time.

Most experienced with
- Server Administration (*NIX, VPS, Docker)
- PHP (Wordpress framework)
- Javascript/Typescript (Frontend/React and Gutenberg Blocks development)
- CSS3/SCSS (Frontend styling and design)

I am an experienced administrator of LAMP stacks (Primarily Ubuntu server management.) I&#039;ve developed dozens of custom plugins and themes for clients on the Wordpress platform.
I&#039;ve also done a number of &quot;emergency interventions&quot; for compromised websites. (Hardening the platform, using Apache to strengthen sensitive areas, using CLI tools like grep to search for and eliminate compromising scripts, etc.)

Experienced user in:
- Github/Git
- A number of IDE&#039;s (I prefer VSC and GNU Emacs)
- Unix CLI (I use WSL for my development)

I have experience with the following technologies and have done or worked on projects with them, though they haven&#039;t been my primary focus.
- socket.io
- Mozilla Audio Webkit
- Java
- Python (Primary experience with matplotlib, pandas, numpy and datasets)
- C/C++
- Unreal Game Engine (C++ and Blueprints)

Other
----
As a well-rounded geek, it&#039;s inevitable that I end up with my fingers in multiple cookie jars over the years. I have passion for and have done personal projects over the years in other fields such as:
- Video production
- Game development
- Visual Effects and AV post-processing
- 3D Animation and modeling
- Audio Engineering and sound design
- Music Production (Production and Mastering)
- Data Analysis (Python)
- Photo Manipulation and Editing
- Icon and graphics creation

Misc Talents
- Fluent Spanish speaker (Viví en Chile por dos años y aprendí el Éspañol mientras que estuve allí.)
- I&#039;m a musician as a hobby and write music in my freetime.
- I can probably kick your butt in a round of Mario Smash Brothers Melee

My earliest programming memory is of my father teaching me procedural programming logic with Q-Basic on an old MS-DOS machine at about age 10.
When I was 16, I built and maintained my first site.

I also have countless years of online SEO/Marketing experience through everything from Google Adwords, Direct Online Marketing, Backlinking, and modern Ad Campaigns through social media.

Go ahead and shoot me an invitation. I&#039;ll take a look at it.
May the force be with you!

---------------------
Is there any reason to not hire me?
If any of the following apply to your project, please save us both time and do not submit a request:
---------------------
- If you&#039;re looking for $10/hr work, I AM NOT IT.
- If you want a tiny $20 fixed price project, I&#039;m not interested. It takes time to meet and get details on a project and $20 for meeting up plus the time to implement the solution just isn&#039;t worth it for me.
- You want someone to build you a blockchain/crypto/NFT related website. I refuse to contribute to the environmental and social harm that the current hysteria around this system has produced. Please leave me out of your get-rich-quick schemes and educate yourself about the system you&#039;re senselessly promoting.","          151,175.79",2943,               51.36,3,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~0197b42294de29cb24/)

I am a composer &amp; sound designer based in London. I produce and compose music and sound for various media, including animation agencies, commercial agencies, individual musicians, advertisement and video production companies, and YouTube content creators. 

Different sounds are like different seeds. They are impregnated by surprising and original symphonies. Thus any sound can be the basis of a long and astonishing musician piece. That&#039;s why I always love to play with virtual instruments and synths. My passion for sounds motivated me to work with a myriad of virtual orchestral instruments and synthesisers. I also get and share my inspiration using sound effect libraries and foley world. 

I play various stringed instruments, including all kinds of guitars, banjo, charango, and keyboards. For ten years, I have been immersing myself in music theory and rhythm. Other than courses, what taught me the most has been working with musicians across the world. And still, I am eager to learn more. There is always something new to learn.

In 2020, I started my music and sound production company in London, the Soundpot. Currently, I produce music for a cartoon series and offer services for several voice-over projects.

After many live performances with different bands and musicians, I decided to explore music as a storytelling medium which sparked my interest in film-making, leading me to earn a degree in film in 2011.

Common problems I hear when music producers try to mix and master themselves:

🔇 Your track doesn’t translate well on a variety of audio systems. There is a simple reason for this;
🔇 There is no depth. Tons of reverb and delays but the sound is still tiny and washy;
🔇 Total mess in the low end. Kick and Sub compete with each other. I know you think about eq, sidechain, and filters. Stop! Don’t let them destroy everything;
🔇 Dull Vocals. You have used all possible effects, but it is still dull. There is a solution;
🔇 Overcompressed sound. That’s a common problem for somebody who wants to get a loud track but ends up with an overcompressed and weak sound;
🔇 Misconception of loudness. How loud should I master my songs? Streaming services have their own rules, but big artists do not care. 🤔

I can continue the list, but I’m here to solve these problems. Let professionals do their job and you will be surprised. 💎

My Sevices:

✅ Single/Album Mixing;
✅ Single/Album Mastering;
✅ Additional Production (if needed): Sound Design, Sample Replacement, Arrangement Development;
✅ Manual Vocal Tuning/Pitch Correction;
✅ Audio Editing/Cleaning.

Crucial Steps:

1️⃣ Contact me via Upwork. I always respond within 24 hours (even if I am overloaded with work);
2️⃣ Send me your demo (raw version of your track), and I will listen and let you know about specific details;
3️⃣ Send me your multitrack. Format: Wav 44.1khz/24bit (at least). Make sure that all tracks begin from a zero point;
4️⃣ I will estimate the price and time individually for your project;
5️⃣ We agree on terms and I start to work on your project.

Deliveries:

✅ 44.1khz/24bit wav files. This is a common format for digital distribution on streaming platforms.
✅ DDP format of your album. DDP is commonly used for the delivery of disc pre-masters for duplication.
✅ Mp3 or AAC for your own use.

The right sound can improve your game, animation or movie project significantly and increase the value of your work by 100% I always advise to go with a professional sound artist and would never recommend doing it yourself or &quot;last minute&quot; - using quick sound clips you found on the internet, resulting in an amateurish end product that gives you a bad reputation.

I have specialized on composing classical and modern music, as well as sound effects, logo indents, stingers, trailers and atmospheres for any type of media. I can also take care of mixing the final sound layer and mastering it for release.

I have been working with several large clients in the past and have 10+ years of experience in this field. Most of which resulted in great connections to other music professionals and artists. Instrumentalists, Animators, Copywriters and Voiceover Actors among them.

My work is licensed by many happy clients, government officials, creative agencies, publishers, film makers, animators, photographers and web companies (Google).","           10,484.88",4,"            2,621.22",22,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~0150a07088db44de64/)

&quot;Walder is a MASTER!... I was extremely satisfied with his work, the result was beyond what I was expecting... you can tell an artist made this!... 
When I  first listened to the track, there was basically a standing ovation in my mind,!... 
I ended with tears in my eyes because I can feel he not only used his talent but also put passion and dedication to achieve what I was looking for.  I ended with no words to thank him! He understood exactly what this project was about and he delivered not only extraordinary results but also in less time than initially projected... I didn&#039;t even have to make any changes it was just perfect.
Not only he was able to recreate what I was looking for but he also added more details that made the final result shine even more. Only a real artist can do that!&quot;

&quot;Walder is fantastic-- his turnaround is incredibly quick and the quality of his recordings is outstanding. Additionally, he was very supportive in helping us verify that our translations were correct and accurate, both in terms of grammar and meaning. Highly recommend working with him!&quot;

575,Jamie F.,Stirling,Professional audiobook/podcast editing and mastering engineer,"Hi there! 

My name is a Jamie Flynn, a musician, an audio engineer and audiobook/podcast editor from Stirling, Scotland. 

With over 10 years of work in both audio production and music, I have valuable experience in a wide range of areas. Recently, I aimed to specialise in audio recording, mixing, editing and production after taking ownership of a music studio which affords me the time, space and resources to produce quality work in this field. 

With regards to audio editing, to date I have edited over 200 podcasts (a mixture of heavy and light editing) with nothing but positive feedback. Alongside this, I have produced over 35 audio books that have passed ACX standards and are currently hosted on Audible, &#039;The Summer Sand Pact&#039; by Jessie Newton (Narrated by Jill Smith) being the most recent upload. I also recently recorded, edited and produced a significant amount of narration for a corporate meditation app, as well as Dr David R Hamilton&#039;s latest work (Hay House UK Publishing)

As I am also a professional musician, I have married my skills in these fields to allow me to write, record and produce my own music to a high standard. These productions proved to be extremely successful in booking a recently completed coast to coast tour of Canada.  

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask! 

I hope to hear from you soon,

577,Berke Cemil B.,Istanbul,"Beatmaker, Composer, Writer","I make beats daily, mostly melodic beats with hard 808&#039;s. I also rap. I independently write songs and screenplays.

First of all let me express my strong suits.

I grew up with rap music in my ears. So i am good at making

Melodic Hip-Hop beats
Old School beats
Trap beats
Lyricism
Writing

I&#039;ve graduated from Istanbul University, Bachelor&#039;s Degree in Italian Language and Literature.

Word plays, puns, sense of humour... Literature was the key of making people and most importantly myself entertained along the way. 


This is why i adored music, for me it is like a time machine for both directions. An emotional black hole that even time can not escape from it, but you can travel freely.

Loved music since crib, i&#039;ve got taste for any kind of music, but enough about me. I&#039;m here to help you guys.

Simplicity is the key to write a song or compose a beat, my workflow consists of 3 fundamental elements,

Simplicity
Imagination
Taking action

Third one is the most important one. People suppose that people tend to leave their work half-way done, this is not quite true, the real problem is, people do not even START!

Let&#039;s say you have an idea, a brilliant one. What happens if you just sit and wait it to become real? You get NOTHING!

It ain&#039;t going to write or compose itself! I can not stress this enough.

Obviously you guys have the first two and if you lack the knowledge of the last one, that is where i come in. 
Taking action does not mean YOU have to do all the stuff. 

Brief me quickly about the subject, and i will help you along the way.

A feedback from one of of my satisfied clients.

The quality of your podcast and audio recordings is of my top priority. I am not just an audio editor but a creative sound designer as well. I specialize in audio enhancement, restoration and design. A living one stop shop for audio matters.

Each and every recording is different. The ambient noises around differ too. Oftentimes, it is so frustrating to record a high quality podcast interview with a very poor audio quality. Quality is of the essence for the listeners and I deeply understand that.

No matter the quality of your recordings, we can make it of top caliber by the proven methods I used for 11 years of working in the radio and podcast industry. I do not rely on templates and presets because I consider that every recording is different- which means that they need distinct equalization, amount and technique of restoration (noise removal), compression and mastering.  

And even your voice needs a distinct and unique equalization and compression to achieve the best possible fine-tuned enhancement for your voice quality. 

With the right tools and software (Adobe Audition, Izotope Ozone, Izotope Nectar, Era-D, Era-N, Izotope RX, Zynaptiq) and with the right combination and layering of those, I had successfully accomplished a wide array of audio recordings- from business, self-help, fashion, christian podcasts to creative stories and radio jingles and advertisement.

Let me help you with that! And together, we can make your audio projects the best that it can be.

And it&#039;s a plus because I do have a lot of experience  in video editing too- from screencasts to vlogs to one-minute videos, Facebook ad product videos, YouTube channel intros and end screen, speaker and sizzle reel.

607,Liam M.,London,"Writer, Actor (Voice/Physical), Music Producer","Hello! My name is Liam Murphy, and I am able to help clients with a range of different processes! Lets take a look at what I can offer you:

Writing:

I graduated from Queen Mary University with a Joint Honours Degree in Drama and English. Whilst studying I penned essays and reviews of many different subjects, from insights into the cultural impact of the Tupac hologram at Coachella, to an analysis of Moby Dick. I also wrote poems that were published in local journals, and wrote and directed a play that was performed in London at the famous Edinburgh Fringe Festival! After a brief period teaching English, I began working as a freelance writer. In the 5-year period I have worked as writer I have communicated with clients across the globe and written in a number of different formats. 

I am incredibly familiar with the worlds of art, film and music which can be evidenced in my article writing for prestigious publications such as DJ Mag, GIGsoup and my own popular blog listencorp. I have written articles for successful travel magazines and business publications as well, including The Luxury Report and The European. I love to write insightful and engaging articles, combining them with an adept knowledge of SEO.

I love to write PR, and have done so for a number of different ventures, from Cybersecurity companies to fantastic music labels releasing incredible music on vinyl and cassette. I am adept at writing meta-descriptions and currently work with a top music library, ensuring that every track they release is described accurately and with thought to SEO search terms.

Due to my experience in making magazines, I can also help you to bring a pamphlet, zine, booklet or introductory guide to life! 

Voice acting:

Since leaving University, my acting talents have been utilised by companies and self-starters all over the world. I have delivered stellar voice acting for charitable causes, artistic blogs and insightful YouTube videos. I love to bring a script to life in a way that is exciting and clear. I am able to instil passion into a voiceover if needs be, and can also utilise my talents to become different characters as well. I have a professional set-up in my home, and am an intermediate user of the audio program Ableton.

Music producer:

I have been making music my whole life. From learning guitar at a young age, I began to play in bands and at local festivals and venues. As I grew up I began to collaborate with other musicians and also offer music for other areas of the artistic realm. This is mostly highlighted in the work I have done for theatre performances. I have composed music and sound for a range plays, from Shakespeare&#039;s Titus Andronicus to a play about asking your boss for a raise! I make music under several different aliases and have had songs played on Radio 1 and NTS Radio. I enjoy making music profusely, and am always up for a challenge.

That is a brief rundown of what I can offer, but don&#039;t be afraid to reach out with something esoteric or something I haven&#039;t mentioned. I pride myself on pleasing clients, and I am always happy to help with anything you are working on.","           15,288.25",16,              945.66,3,[UpworkerLink](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~0152b9cbeac40ac08c/)

p.s. when it comes to videography, every project is unique and requires a different amount of time and resources to complete. Hourly rates can be a useful tool in some industries, but in the world of videography, they do not always accurately reflect the value of the work being done. Instead, I prefer to work on a project basis. This means that we will agree on a total fee for the project based on its scope and requirements. This allows me to dedicate the necessary time and attention to every aspect of the project and deliver high-quality results without worrying about time constraints.

“My Advertising Company is working with a very important client of ours. At 11:30am today, I was notified that the world famous actress we were working with had to back out of the project for personal reasons. Imagine the panic. To my surprise, by 3:30pm Louise had delivered us the exact voice over that I was looking for. I choose her because the tone and warmth in her voice was fantastic, but it her range that really impressed. She delivered us a haunting, compelling and spectacular read. No doubt, we will use her again and again.” 5 stars, Michael Popove, President, PictureHouse Media Group

“ELITE-LEVEL TALENT!! ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!! Louise is a tremendously gifted professional actress that is one of rare talents that could be trusted with the most challenging projects in Hollywood and elsewhere. This was a very complex and difficult project with dozens of characters and tens of thousands of words. Louise performed each and every part, even the relatively minor ones, with tremendous talent, intelligence, and creativity! From mastering difficult pronunciations to creating a vast range of believable accents and personalities, Louise worked and delivered results at a truly elite level! AMAZING!” 5 stars, Dominic Blais, Independent RPG creator

“After hearing Louise’s performance, our clients said: “Very high voice quality – ‘timbre’ as some would call it. Even her ‘breathy’ performance in a couple of spots works well because it humanizes our message. Tell Louise she has a powerful, grabbing voice!!”” 5 stars, David, advertising professional, USA

“Louise is an amazing Artist! There are no limits for her to complete any task! She did a great job with 7 characters, changing voices, intuitively identifying the character&#039;s emotion and tone. Excellent audio records mastering. Great communication. Always offers voice acting options. Fast delivery! Highly recommend!” 5 stars, Tumarfilm, filmmaker, Kazahkstan

“It was very nice and easy to work with Louise. I&#039;m working on a fantasy animation and asked for an eldery dramatic voice which she did perfectly. She gave me even four versions to pick from.” 5 stars- Franz, video animator from Austria

I offer editing and post-production services to organizations still finding their voice in today&#039;s media landscape.

I build narrative-driven, documentary-style content for educators, scientists, and community advocates.  As a producer, I’m often in the position of editing voices different from my own, so I work closely with you during the production process to ensure I edit accurately and sensitively.

I&#039;ve worked on projects that highlight:
- Climate change
- Science education
- Ecology
- Alaska life
- Arctic issues
- LGBTQ stories
- Cross-cultural collaborations

I’ve worked with artists and researchers both as a producer and as a fellow artist/research assistant. I aim to keep the production process transparent for when you&#039;re ready to take the reins on content creation.

My degrees are a doctorate (ABD) in Language &amp; Communication from the University of Southern Denmark, an MPhil in Linguistics from the University of Cambridge, and a BA in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science from Vassar College.

Decades as a life learner has blessed me with a vast skillset.

 A former creative director at HMH Agency may have said it best. 

&quot;When Burt came in to show his book I knew within 5 minutes we wanted this guy at HMH, which at the time was growing but still small and needed a designer who was multi-faceted. Though my expectations of him were high, Burt quickly exceeded them. He was entrepreneurial and had a good grasp of business yet he was creatively driven at the core. He had high standards. He also possessed a unique world view and was unafraid to express it -- valuable to an ad agency hungry to make its mark. All this gave us a person who would give it all to any project put in front of him. If he didn&#039;t know something, he&#039;d learn it. Video, sound, CGI, illustration, photography, web development whatever. And he&#039;d not only learn it quickly, but the outcome would be golden. Think of him this way: MacGyver graduates RISD. To top it all off, Burt&#039;s perhaps the most respectful person I&#039;ve met in this business and a great collaborator in a team environment. I am not surprised to be seeing him now leading start ups and continuing to evolve his creative career. If you need a sharp, innovative thinker -- either as a staffer or a hired gun -- who can help you shape out a business or marketing concept, get this guy involved and you&#039;ll like what happens.&quot;

A couple more testimonials...

&quot;I&#039;ll always have great memories of when I worked with Burt. Crazy memories, but great. Burt is a true renaissance-creative – design, motion, illustration, photography. He has a passion for doing exceptional work. Of all the people I&#039;ve worked with in this business over the years, he is high on the list for being genuine, fun and talented.&quot;

&quot;Burt is an interactive genius. One of the most easy people to work with and has a unique skillset of design and back-end development. If you get a chance to work with Burton, don&#039;t hesitate!&quot;

Color grading exclusively with DaVinci Resolve helped me to shape images for award-nominated short films, feature films, music videos and commercials, to come up with something that is a collaborative effort.

Using color to elevate your creative vision is something I’m always passionated about, and having a degree in film and visual arts, makes me pay special attention about the overall story arc and what is color going to do to support it.

A keen eye for detail and a solid workflow describes me the most. More importantly, I love my craft and the talented people I work with.

Thanks for reading! I&#039;m Wes, I write professional-grade copy that focuses on selling or telling stories about products and services.

One of the main reasons I&#039;m such a powerful writer is because I am responsible for writing and producing a daily newscast Monday through Friday that is watched by tens of thousands of people in the highly competitive San Francisco Bay Area market.

My 15 years of news writing has developed my extensive vocabulary which is full of active, action-taking words that are meant to move people and keep them watching or reading. 

I am very good at getting people to take action by using only a few choice words.  

My experience as a journalist allows me to easily find new ways or new stories that can be used to market your product or service.

I have an incredible talent for ingesting the story of a product, why it is important to customers, and retelling that faster and more effectively. 
 
I have also been trained to work under the most intense of daily deadlines. That means I can most likely get your project done faster than other copywriters.

I understand the importance of words and how quickly using the wrong ones can make potential customers run away. 

I have no doubt I can bring the same enthusiasm you have for your company into the few, very critical words you have to represent it.  

So, let&#039;s make sure your copy is great copy, and let&#039;s make money!

📰News/Politics
🎼Music/Musical Instruments/Recording/Engineering/Mixing
🚴‍♀️Fitness/Exercise/Nutrition
⚽Sports

732,Rachel E.,Vaughan,Creative Copywriter/Brand Voice Sniper,"Hey there! Does your brand need a voice? 🎤 Cool, here’s my flex: Born and bred, I’m a copywriting chameleon, hardwired to soak up your brand’s persona like a second skin—a creative screen that filters my every sentence, sound and syllable, I don’t fudge around (….excusez la vulgarité 💚). Formally-trained and idea-savvy, I lead a 11-year record of crafting copy for brands including Kraft Heinz, Tiffany &amp; Co. Perfume, COTY Inc. and SheaMoisture.🔥🔥🔥

Basically, I&#039;m Batman.

💚🍎 HOW I SERVE YOU 🍎💚

Your goals are my goals. When you&#039;re my client, we&#039;re a team. Period.

Versed in Psychology, Semiotics and Language Arts, I’m a master manipulator who toys with the cerebral power of words. My goal? To convince your readers to ACT—to sway their emotions and spark their desires. Hence, you’ll see clicks, conversions and sales. Case closed.

Sooooooooo, ready to convert your  window shoppers into buyers?!!!  It starts with knowing human nature. What do they crave? Safety? Status? Sexy times?!!! Whatever the dangling carrot, I’ll press the right neural buttons! Let’s get your CUSTOMERS TO ACT!  And that, my friends, is the crux of my copy--my clever, crisp, calculated, conversion-crunching copy….(Ahhhhhhh, literary gasm)….✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️✏️

K, weird segue. Moving on. 

Creating copy that drives your customers emotionally is a process that goes deeper than diction. It’s about saying a message that evokes a pulse. Through my years studying poetry, I’ve analyzed the art of manipulating syllables to achieve the right metric patterns, syntax and diction to differentiate a brand’s voice and inspire ACTION. And it works!😄👌

💚🍎 A BIT ABOUT ME 🍎💚

As an academic and artist, I’m a serious professional who provides the best of both worlds: technical accuracy and creativity. I have my B.A in English, B.A in Art History and B.Ed in Education--along with my OCT qualification (Ontario Certified Teacher) for Language Arts.

Outside of branding, when I&#039;m not milking my creativity to its last drop, I enjoy the following pursuits: mindlessly scrolling through Netflix, food-sampling at Costco and complaining about the need for more House of Dragon episodes.

💚🍎MY CLIENT-FRIENDLY POLICIES &amp; PRACTICES🍎💚

Here are some friendly guidelines I apply with all my clients. I don’t have this criteria to differentiate myself from other writers (I assume they all do the same), I have them only to ensure a positive client experience. 

- Any research involved in developing your brand is included in the discovery phase 
- I include two rounds of revisions for each brand book for the purposes of fine-tuning the tone &amp; style
- All content that you purchase belongs to you fully. Always.
- I do not charge any fees for including free images 
- Don&#039;t be embarrassed to ask me ANY questions! If you’re new to brand book design, I’m happy to advise on any decisions such as project procedures, tone development, taglines, ect.

By going through multiple rounds, it leaves us will a concept that only now needs to be designed on the computer. Seeing the idea sketched out will leave little guess work for what&#039;s to come.

741,Doina T.,Chisinau,"Illustrator, 2D animator","Hello! 
   I am a passionate, hardworking and highly dedicated illustrator and 2d animator who enjoys drawing and animating stories.

   I have 7 years of working in illustration,  1,5 years of working on a frame by frame animated movie, and then 3 years of working as an independent freelance 2d animator.

   I studied Fine Arts at the Art Academy of Moldova, which was like a big playground where I could learn all kind of things, including the basics in drawing, painting, illustration, so I pride myself on being able to draw anything professionally and also, I am used to deadlines, but at the core of the studies was learning to think in a conceptual way. So, most important was the idea behind and the ability to substantiate it. This definitely left an impact on the way I work. 
  Later i did a master degree in animation at the Academy of Fine Arts from Chișinău, Moldova. There I learned about dramaturgy and other things more related to animation and film making. My passion for animation grew from my illustration work. After some experimenting with animation and discovering that excitement of seeing your drawings being “alive” there was no way back!

I&#039;m a Michigan-based storyteller with a holistic approach to creating compelling content to outdo your project goals. I stitch together compelling words and stunning visuals to create dynamic content aimed at delivering consumer engagement and SEO rankings. With a background in journalism, I have a nose for news, but excel in creative writing, content development, and editing. I truly shine in that sweet spot where the written word and polished visuals converge to tell a story, promote a brand, or sell a product. 

I have two years&#039; experience in the newsroom, specializing in personal interest stories, environmental issues, investigative reporting, and social justice issues. Camera at my side, I often captured the essence of a story in a single photograph. But my shutter doesn&#039;t close on news alone. I&#039;m obsessed photographing what makes life worth living. From weddings and architecture to nature and product photography, my photographic skills offer another tool to convey a richer story.

Concentrating on my writing has sharpened my creative writing skills, as it has forced me to become a more focused writer...having to describe the changes one goes through, to those who have never been faced with the condition, requires very thoughtful and visually description phrasing.

799,Alexandra D.,London,Top-rated flexible and experienced proofreader/editor,"Have you created some text that you&#039;d like a second pair of eyes to look over, checking the sense and refining it with perfect grammar and spelling? Or maybe English isn&#039;t your first language, and you&#039;d like some help to make your copy read like it was written by a native speaker?

Either way, you&#039;ve come to the right place! My speciality is working with texts both long and short, and from all backgrounds, weeding out the typos and tweaking phrases or sentences to help the language flow as well as possible. My default is British English, but I&#039;m happy to work in different styles (such as US English) or follow a set style guide.

I started editing shortly after finishing my degree at Oxford 20 years ago, and am now a full-time freelancer working on all sorts of projects from my home office. I have a flexible but focused attitude to work and am often available for quick turnaround projects. I frequently work with people who don&#039;t have English as a mother tongue, and will put in the effort to make sure your text sounds like it&#039;s been written by a native speaker. I work primarily in British English but am happy to adapt to US/Australian styles where needed.

What sort of projects do I work on?

• Magazine work
In the past I have worked as a subeditor for major UK magazines including BBC Good Food, Food &amp; Travel, Lonely Planet Traveller, Good Housekeeping and Vogue; and as a subeditor/proofreader for customer publications for major brands including Marks &amp; Spencer, English Heritage, Aston Martin and P&amp;O Cruises. I now take on magazine proofreading and editing projects from home, using Word, PDFs or InDesign as appropriate.

I hold a diploma in Magazine Editorial from the London School of Publishing.

• Book/ebook proofreading

My proofreading projects have included numerous books for Flame Tree Publishing, Alliance Publishing Trust and Ashgate Publishing, as well as texts for self-publishing clients.

• Academic editing/proofreading

I have worked on several essay submissions and journal articles for UK universities and other institutions around Europe. I understand how to avoid plagiarism and can work with several referencing styles including Harvard, Chicago, MLA and APA referencing.

I hold both a BA degree from Oxford University and a Masters  degree from London (Royal Academy of Music). I have recently (October 2019) completed an Academic Proofreading course with Proofreading Academy (London) to brush up my skills.

• Website/blog proofreading

I have worked on several corporate websites and personal blogs to refine the text while preserving the owner’s individual tone of voice. For this work I have had repeat clients and have ongoing contracts with others who appreciate a second pair of eyes. I am happy to work in Wordpress or provide Word documents with changes tracked.

Based on my previous experience and modern trends in the development world, I can tell you with confidence - if your main aim is to create a complex web application with a difficult structure and many features on the Back-end and Front-end parts we can use React and Node.js for a successful result. 

But, sometimes it&#039;s not enough, so, I can help in this situation too, because have experience with such technologies as Bootstrap, jQuery, Redux, TypeScript, Angular, nginx, Express, Firebase, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Jenkins, Socket.io, WebPack, Babel; AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, uWSGI for deploing and Mocha.js, Chai.js for testing my code to ensure the best result. 

In addition to websites, I recently started making mobile apps as well. Typically, I use React Native, the technology that supports both iOS and Android platforms. So you&#039;ll need a budget dedicated to just one application instead of having a different codebase written for each platform.

I am also have a quite experience in maps integrations. So I can definitely share my technical advice if you would like your project to have some geolocation related features. For implementing of such features I use Google Maps, Mapbox, Reactive Maps and so on.

Also, I good at usage of graphing and charting libraries, so hire me for development of your app and will have a capable of generating charts and graphs with either D3.js, Highcharts, or Google Charts.

Thinks, that I can be a good fit for your needs? Don&#039;t hesitate to drop me a line with your requirements and let&#039;s have a chat to discuss your idea in details. Would be glad to help you build a great platform 

See you soon,

I&#039;m currently fully self-employed as a freelance content writer. 

I primarily write marketing-focused content in the form of core website content (i.e., home pages, product/service pages, about us pages), blog posts, informational articles, landing pages, and anything else that my clients require for their content marketing efforts. I have written for a wide variety of clients, including SEO and digital marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and small businesses of many types. I have experience with SEO content writing/copywriting.

Due to my varied experience, I can adapt my writing and editing styles to suit many different industries and clients. I always work closely with my clients to develop content that matches their brand&#039;s voice and helps them meet their marketing and business goals.

In addition to content writing and editing, I&#039;m able to translate content between English and Spanish. I specialize in North American English (Canadian and US American spelling varieties) and Latin American Spanish (Colombian vernacular). I can quickly translate content from Spanish to English and edit/revise it to make it sound fluent and native. I have done this for Latin American clients who want to market their products in North America.

I am organized, independent, and capable of managing multiple tasks and deadlines. I have experience working as part of a team both in an office setting and remotely. I currently work 100% remotely from my home office and maintain a flexible schedule. My writing style is clear and articulate, and I can adapt the voice and tone of my writing to suit the goals and needs of each project.

803,Angela K.,Littleton,"Writer, Editor, and Proofreader","I am a Colorado native, and for the past several years, I&#039;ve been a freelance writer. Before becoming a full-time writer, I worked in fields ranging from healthcare to taxes to politics. Regardless of the position I held, I ended up the person asked to write and edit all of the high-stakes content. I am a quick study; I can learn highly complicated concepts and present them so that your target market is compelled to action. I have helped companies change their tone to more professional, more fun, or more polished, depending on their marketing objectives. I have ghostwritten columns for different business-related websites, managed blogs that needed an SEO upgrade, and breathed life into technical, uninspiring content.

No matter the industry, content never need be dull. The English language is one of the most fascinating languages in use, and there is no excuse for its misuse.

808,Dayton S.,Kansas City,Squarespace Developer | Content Strategist | UX Designer,"Hi there! I help businesses grow by creating compelling digital experiences for their customers.

I&#039;ve had the privilege to work with some amazing organizations, like Water.org, KPBS San Diego Public Radio, and Golfweek Magazine. I&#039;ve built dozens of Squarespace sites, coded the frontend of enterprise web apps, and managed $300k website builds. Through it all I have always focused on delivering a product that my client&#039;s customers love.

Today I build sites with Squarespace because they&#039;re easy for my clients.

- Easy means: If you can use email, you can edit your Squarespace site.
- Easy means: If you want to move something around on the page, you can just drag it to where you want it.
- Easy means: You never need a developer to handle endless theme and plugin updates.

My development process makes Squarespace even easier. Together, we will:

1. Discover

- We&#039;ll dive into your business and explore how your website fits into your customer&#039;s journey.
- I&#039;ll help you create goals for every page on your site and show you how to map out your content to convert visitors into leads.
- We&#039;ll go beyond Squarespace&#039;s templates to create a site that&#039;s uniquely yours.

2. Build

- You can get back to business while I lay out your content and create a clean design.
- I&#039;ll get your forms, services, and all the technical stuff setup.
- Together, we&#039;ll review, revise, rinse &amp; repeat until your site is a polished gem.

3. Launch

- I&#039;ll tune your site for SEO success and let Google know about all the new changes we&#039;re making.
- We&#039;ll walk through your site together, making sure you know exactly how easy it is to make updates. 
- Finally - I&#039;ll flip the switches and launch your site into the great, wide internet.

From day one, your site is going to be laser-focused on connecting your audience to your content - and through your content - to you.

The focus on content is key, because your customers aren&#039;t looking to engage with a website. They&#039;re looking to buy your product, ask a question, learn about your services, make a reservation, or hire you. To resonate with those needs, your website needs to be built around your customer&#039;s experience. And I&#039;ve designed my process to do just that, using industry best practices in UX (User Experience) Design.

I can help you if:

1. You want to build a clean, easy-to-use site on Squarespace
2. You need help updating or redesigning your existing Squarespace site
3. You aren&#039;t sure how to organize your site effectively
4. You want your site to convert visitors into customers

812,Cain C.,Redondo Beach,"Results-Focused Brand Builder - Brand Strategy, Identity, Logo Design","Want to build a brand worthy of $10MM of revenue every year and hundred million dollar buyouts? Let me guide you through the branding process industry-leading brands use to bring your vision to life and generate real results.

Together We Can Build The Next Giant, Just Like I Have With:

✅ Origin House - Sold to Cresco Labs for $823MM after rebranding the corporation and its subsidiaries
✅ Golden Trends - Grew their monthly sales by 380%+ following a rebrand in 9 months
✅ Shovel App - Went from 2 to 10,000+ Instagram followers, 75,000+ users, and 150,000+ email subscribers after finding their target audience and their voice
✅ Nuvata - Brought in over $3MM in the California Cannabis market in 2022, Became a Top 5 Brand in Oklahoma

Building a successful brand takes more than just a great logo.

Most business owners get a business idea, pick a name, create a logo, and enter the market.

But they never sit down and map out exactly what makes them different.

They copy competitors to fit in and don’t do anything to stand out.

Then they waste precious time and money trying to sell products from their “Me-too” brand.

“Me-too” brands die in the shadows of the brands they copy, and their owners spend 12 hours a day barely getting by.

I want to help you avoid that painful reality.

True success comes from innovation and differentiation.

Together we’ll go through my process of developing a brand that brings your vision to life and generates SALES.

When we work together, you’ll get:

➢ A breathtaking brand with a profound story
➢ A brand you can show off to your friends and be proud of
➢ A brand built to drive sales and stand the test of time
➢ Something that stands out from your competitors
➢ Gratitude from the people who create for your brand in the future

You might be a good fit if you:

⚡ Have ambitious goals to be a leader in your industry
⚡ Have a truly unique idea or product
⚡ Already have a successful business and want to take it to the next level
⚡ Would rather do things the right way instead of the fast way
⚡ Are in the cannabis, health and wellness, CPG, or tech industries.

I might not be a good fit for you if you:

🚫 Need a brand and website next week
🚫 Want to copy a big brand in your industry and hope to get the same results
🚫 Don’t want to build something unique and long-lasting
🚫 Have small goals and small dreams
🚫 Just want a logo

A Good Brand Needs AT LEAST:

➢ A clear picture of your target audience
➢ A snapshot of what your competitors are doing and how you can stand out
➢ A clearly communicated brand strategy that speaks to your audience
➢ A visually stunning brand identity (logos, fonts, colors) that captivates your consumers
➢ Brand Guidelines to ensure your website and marketing look and perform the same way

About Me:

I run a branding and marketing strategy agency that’s been building and launching award-winning brands since 2018. We typically take brands from idea to launch, then help them scale to 100K+ revenue per month.

Our Full Service List Includes:

• Are not afraid to give constructive criticism when necessary

I have found that I really work well with people who want to be a part of the project or actively engage in the process by means of communication. Generally, with an open communication channel, the sustained momentum usually speeds up project completion times and results in higher quality deliverables.

Working with me you can expect:

• Friendly professionalism
• Quick response &amp; turnaround time
• A high attention to detail

My specialties include branding, typography, packaging, &amp; more. I have worked with clients ranging from small, independently-owned businesses to international entities, addressing their visual design needs. Working together, I will provide you with all you need, including original design files, just in case you need to make future edits with another designer.

I know you want to manage your team&#039;s time well (and have each member of your team working in their personal wheelhouse). In order to do that, though, you need an easy and dependable way to get great content for your business. 

The problem is writing week after week is time-consuming and exhausting. The demand for new content never ends! You feel like you&#039;re spinning your wheels while the rest of your business and the things you LOVE stand by neglected, stalling out, and looking at you with puppy dog eyes. 

I have good news! Ready? Here goes: You can face each week without the pressure and burden of writing everything in-house. It&#039;s true. You don&#039;t have to personally write everything for your business. (Go on, take a deep breath, and read that sentence again...feels good to imagine, doesn&#039;t it?) 

Here&#039;s how: Me. I write for you. (Yep. It&#039;s that simple.) 

Just listen to a few things I&#039;ve heard from clients: 

&quot;It would have taken me hours to sound that good!&quot;
&quot;The emails are freakin&#039; perfect, per usual!&quot;
“Your style of writing is exactly what I was looking for!”
&quot;Thanks to your article, we saw sales of the featured items increase.”

Here is what I do: I create turnkey content for small businesses, start-ups, and well-known brands that frees up your team and alleviates your stress. Plus, I am easy to get along with and I have a no-drama and polite work ethic.

-Blog editing
-Business writing 
-Digital marketing
-Editing and proofreading
-Real estate (commercial and residential)
-Bonus skills include WordPress &amp; Google Suite

&quot;Moving a wall 10 cm on a blueprint costs almost nothing; moving it when a house is halfway-built has a high cost&quot;
-- Steve McConnell, &quot;Code Complete 2&quot; (quoted from memory)

It&#039;s important to lay a good foundation for a project of any kind - clear goals, expectations, and performance indicators; people that are skilled and willing to cooperate; and so on. Oftentimes, the issues arise when the business is scaling - a process that worked fine for a small team or a handful of clients starts tearing at the seams as there are more people and projects. New challenges require optimized solutions.

The most distinct and high-value skills that I offer you are strategic - capacity for analysis, setting up and improving processes, anticipating potential issues. 

Here are some other skills and qualities that would be at your disposal:

➪ Excellent planning and prioritization, efficiently managing multiple processes and projects.

➪ Human Resource management - hired dozens of freelancers on Upwork across multiple clients and various fields (design, writing, development, marketing, music, etc). Due to the established filtering/vetting process, all people who were eventually hired were ranging from &quot;very good&quot; to &quot;awesome&quot;.

➪ Natural emotional intelligence augmented by studies of psychology and social psychology. This skill helps in creating a pleasant work environment and in successfully communicating with different people.

➪ Constantly self-educating, high self-control and motivation let me learn new things rapidly. If there&#039;s something I need for work or for the achievement of personal goals, I research and dig into it very fast.

➪ Knowledge of the development cycle. Did some back-end work myself, adding substantial customizations to websites and Shopify stores - changing the storefront, adding features, integrating apps and services. Trying to follow the best practices in coding.

➪ Sense of humor and positive attitude towards life and people.

845,Essi P.,Kotka,Native Finnish content writer/translator of various topics,"🌟Native Finnish speaker 🌟 Fluent with English 🌟 LATAM Spanish speaker 🌟

Content Writing, SEO Writing, Copywriting, Link Building, Translation, Transcription and many more. My favorite niches are iGaming, Gambling, eSports, Finance and specially Cryptos, Lifestyle and History

👋So who am I? I am Essi. And this is about my experience! 🌟

I have just a short history with UpWork, but I have been working as a Content Writer since 2017. Since the end of the summer 2021 I have been in UpWork. I am a freelancer but nowadays I work through my own company as a freelancer.

I can say that I know what I am doing, when I take my laptop and start to write. My experience is long and strong, I know how to make content compelling and inspiring. These years have made me learn a lot and I can say that I am good at my job. Big part of my clients are long-term clients and we have been working together since the beginning. 

Are you looking for unique and flawless content that flows naturally? Then we should talk and see how amazing content we can build together. I know how to make the subject sound interesting and how to catch readers attention. If you are looking for me, send me a message and let&#039;s talk about it!

We all know that there are a lot of SEO “experts”.  I am not going to be one of those “experts”. I would love to say that I know everything about SEO, but that is never going to be true. SEO is never settling and always on constant change. So I do my best to keep in the saddle by keeping myself learning more and more all the time. 

Professional SEO writing is not just an article. It is clear and natural flowing content that inspires and makes readers feel compelled. It has the right keywords and links. It is not boring and made with bad grammar. 

I give my heart to every article I make. I am not rushing those through, because I always give my focus 100 % for each article I write. If there would be a situation where you wouldn’t be satisfied with my article, then I would fix the issues and I wouldn’t let you down!  

===================================================================

🌟 What I offer for you as a client 🌟

✅ I am offering my experience as a Content Writer. I will help your business grow with high-quality content.

✅I am not stretching the deadlines, so you don’t need to be worried about delays. I take only those tasks I can deliver on-time. I am not letting you down!

✅I will take only those projects where I can be useful. If I am not able to provide you with what you need, then I am not going to waste your time nor my own. 

✅I don’t need you to hold my hand, because I am able to work independently. If I need to ask something, I will do that. 

✅Good communication. If you send me a message, I will reply as soon as I see the message. Sometimes we may be in different time zones and it will take some time. BUT I will get back to you as soon as possible.

✅I am professional. I will tell you what I can do and how much time it is going to take. I will also tell you if I need some information from you. 

✅I care about my clients. I always give my best. I consider myself as a kind and peaceful person who is easy to talk to.  

===================================================================


🌟 Here is some feedback from my clients, so you can see what you can expect from me 🌟

&quot;Excellent work provided, great communication and nice to work with! Looking forward to our next cooperation!&quot;

&quot;Essi helped with translation of my site from English to Finnish. Very attentive to detail and won’t quit until the customer is happy&quot;

&quot;It is my great pleasure to write this testimonial for Essi. I&#039;ve had the pleasure of viewing her professional development, and can state with confidence that she is a motivated and responsible person with a high degree of integrity. Her response to my emails is superfast and she is known for her quick turnaround. I&#039;m very happy to be working with her and will continue to work with her&quot;

“Essi is friendly and nice. She is really helpful with this project!”

===================================================================
⭐Conclusion⭐

We both know that words have a lot of power. One sign of my talent is that you are still reading. You already know that I give my best and you don’t need to be worried about my quality. You also know that you came to read my profile because of some reason. So tell me, what do you have in mind? 

If you feel that I am what you are looking for, you can just send me a message. Then we can check together what we can do. We can speak about your wishes and what you want to achieve, after that, we can check what I am able to do. I will answer back to you as soon as I can, so you don’t need to wait for my answer for days. 

Together we can make your ideas grow and your dreams come true!

854,Mary-Helen R.,Enterprise,Copywriting that Converts | Website Consultation,"Hi, I&#039;m Mary Helen, a professional writer with a track record for engaging readers and converting them into clients. My websites, emails, and other collateral dramatically boost conversions. I like to say that I write primo emo ... I write human, and everyone&#039;s looking for more of that these days.

My approach? I use the Story Brand approach to clarify the company brand, who the customers are and what they&#039;re looking for, and how a product or service will result in their success. Then I write concise, relatable copy that supports the brand and builds loyalty. 

Does building loyalty sound amorphous? It&#039;s not really. My writing style feels authentic to readers. Your copy will sound grounded, real, and alive with your personality. People trust authenticity. So, back to basics ... my writing converts!

But you don&#039;t have to take it from me, listen to what my clients have said about me:

• Mary Helen has made a significant difference in our conversions. She digs to understand what you want, then works with you to attain your goal and beyond. I&#039;ll have her &quot;on my staff&quot; for a long time!

• She has a unique ability to listen to your brand vision, understand what you&#039;re thinking, and bring it to life. 

• She&#039;s a consummate professional, committed and dedicated to seeing your project succeed. 

Here&#039;s the shortlist of collateral I produce:

** Website copy &amp; landing pages
** Autoresponder emails
** Articles &amp; blog posts
** White papers, flyers, brochures, eBooks
** Tag lines and loglines
** Video scripts &amp; speeches
** Product descriptions

I also offer website consultation if you want to make your existing copy and flow more effective. I&#039;m adept at spotting the problems and highlighting the gold -- your site will sing and convert.

If my style sounds good to you and you&#039;re great to work with, contact me and let&#039;s talk about your project!

859,Tanya M.,Clearwater,"Marketing, Design, Management, Copy Writing &amp; Blogging","Although I have only been with Upwork for a few years, I am not new to freelancing. I have been working from home for clients for approximately 20 years. My skills range from ad &amp; copywriting to website design &amp; marketing as well as public relations, email marketing, social media, and SEO.

Over the years, I have operated as a business manager and a marketing manager for several small, entrepreneurial clients, while also providing other marketing services to other larger clients. 

I manage online websites, and marketing campaigns. I also provide some customer service via chat or email or support systems like Zendesk as a part of assisting my clients with their day-to-day operations.  

I develop and manage marketing campaigns for their websites and products or services.  I provide ongoing monthly service or I can provide project services such as SEO, SMO, ad copy, website copy, blogs, articles, press releases, and social media marketing.  I also create and develop complete marketing funnels including all the advertising pieces for the funnel such as pop ups, email series, ads, advertorial/blog copy, etc.

I run Facebook, Twitter, and Google ads campaigns. I create email marketing campaigns, create the website and ad copy, and manage online member areas.  Whatever you need, splash pages, whole site redone, projects, mini-sites, social marketing ads, complete email campaigns and/or customer journeys (automated campaigns), I can do it.

I&#039;m proficient in many web design platforms, such as Thrive, WP Bakery, Elementor, Divi, etc.  If I haven&#039;t used your platform, it won&#039;t take me long to get up to speed.  

I use many online tools to create graphics and if you are local to me, I can take the photos you need for your website or ad campaign. I cannot do video, however, and there are graphic artists much better than me out there.  

I can develop and manage sites in Shopify, Wordpress, Squarespace, and Wix.  Ecommerce is not a problem.  

As regards my writing abilities, I have operated as a ghostwriter for clients, writing in their voice to achieve their unique look and feel for their blogs, articles, and/or marketing pieces. 

I am a published author in the education market and have written as a team member on Language Arts projects for many of the major educational materials companies like Scott Foresman, Harcourt, and McGraw Hill. To date, I have over 40 published works.

I also spent many years running PR campaigns during the 90s, which included setting up events, press release writing &amp; distribution resulting in media coverage of those events.  In fact, I have probably generated enough print media to fill a small garage!

I research and write blog articles on any subject unless it is highly technical. I can provide much of the artwork needed either from my stock library that I subscribe to or from my photographs.  I have also written and designed ad copy &amp; graphics, marketing newsletters, email copy, print matter (postcards, brochures, presentations, PowerPoint slides).  

I have written business plans for new businesses seeking financing.  I&#039;ve written marketing and strategy plans for ongoing businesses.  I&#039;ve created implementation plans &amp; projects for new ventures, new products &amp; services, or for retiring products &amp; services.

I am a hard worker who takes pride in my work, my ability to meet deadlines, and my willingness to always be part of the solution and never be a problem. I got rid of my ego a long time ago.  I&#039;m easy to correct and easy to work with, and I have a great sense of humor.

Also, if you want my input I will give it, but if you just need me to execute your game plan, I can do that.  I&#039;m happy to provide the level of strategic interaction or non-interaction that you need.

I&#039;ve uploaded a few samples of my work in the portfolio section.  It is only that which I had permission to show.

You are in the right place!

Why do I do what I do?

I start from the premise that we all have our own unique story and that our stories can inspire and add value to others, this is our superpower as human beings: The power to connect.

My main goal is to make people, children, adults, youngsters, or elders smile and connect with stories via colorful and positive drawings.

I am driven by curiosity: curiosity about possibilities, new ways of seeing something, and challenging established ideas. Positivity, playfulness, and not taking life too seriously are my most serious life mottos.

I discovered how I can bring people together through drawing. Putting a smile on somebody&#039;s face is my biggest passion and purpose in life. I discovered that through illustrations, color, and imagination, this can be achieved, and that is one of my personal superpowers.

Ever since, I have helped to bring smiles by telling people&#039;s, brands, and authors&#039; stories with my illustrations. The best part of it is that it is something that I can keep on doing for the rest of my life.

Let&#039;s draw a smile on people&#039;s faces.

My name is Michael Santos, I am a content creator based out of Los Angeles, CA - with proficiency in the latest versions of Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop. I shoot on a Sony a7s, but have experience with many other cameras as well.

I have 7+ years of experience as a professional videographer and editor - creating content for small businesses and start-ups, social media, YouTube, music videos, you name it! I&#039;ve also worked as a cinematographer for independent films and documentaries. Some of that work has been featured on popular YouTube channels such as [adult swim], and NoBudge, and the MoMa. I very much enjoy the great variety and potential that this industry entails, and I am deeply passionate about creating high-quality, attention-grabbing content.

Here&#039;s how a typical job plays out:

- I work with you to outline the video you want. We discuss your initial thoughts, possibly look at some other videos for example, discuss what kind of gear or personnel (if any) will be needed to achieve this, then set a deadline.

- Usually, I will create a storyboard or shot list to assist with shooting or editing. We&#039;ll both take a look at this and make additions/cuts/rearrangements as needed.

- First draft. I send a rough edit over, with the cut being the main focus. Once the assembly is agreed upon I move on to...

- Color grading, effects, titles, and sound. These are the final cherry on top for the edit. I work with great detail to ensure the video is beautiful.

- Then I create as many different exports as you need (for whatever different platforms they&#039;re going on) as well as a non-compressed version for archive.

Need a video? Let&#039;s talk! Communication is the key to ensuring we get exactly what you&#039;re looking for within our project deadline. I always make time to discuss extensively with my clients what their desired outcomes are so that there&#039;s little confusion on our way to the finish line.

The main type of content work I help clients with revolves primarily around forex and cryptocurrency trading (and occasionally stocks, indices, and commodities) in the following niches:

- Educational articles
- Technical and forecasting analysis
- Guides and reviews of platforms, brokers, crypto, exchanges, and other related products.

906,John W.,Los Angeles,Video Producer/Creator and Editor,"About Me
Consider me your video-production Swiss Army Knife. Capable of opening a can of ideas or tightening up a script and recording voiceover, all using whatever material available to make your video fire!

I&#039;m an experienced video marketing strategist, producer, writer, and editor with over 10 years combined experience.  Whether you&#039;re starting with a blank slate or have everything already created, I can get you across the finish line. 


Why Do YOU Need a One-Stop Shop for Video Production?
Did you know that 51% of marketing professionals worldwide point to video as the medium with the best ROI?  Or that those marketers who use video saw their revenue grow 49% faster than companies that didn&#039;t use it?  OR that 64% of consumers make purchases after watching a video and 91% watch explainer videos to understand a product or service?  So the real question is: Why aren&#039;t you using video services? And more specifically, those of the fine fellow who just gave you all of this knowledge?

Utilizing my copywriting and film production background I work with you to nail down what you want to say and bring it to life using footage, animation, and motion graphics to create engaging, entertaining content that drives viewership, users, and engagement across multiple platforms.  
While I&#039;ve primarily worked on my own the last few years, I have and continue to collaborate with creative directors and business owners; I like to say I&#039;m a collaboratively adaptable.  My copywriting and film production experience affords me the skills to write, storyboard, shoot, direct, and edit material that enhances User Experience and connection to your business, product, and story.

How I Do What I Do
I put the story first.  At the end of the day, people are moved by how your product--and the team behind it--or brand makes them feel. Pain points? Not to worry, everyone has them!  B2B or B2C, I help you solve them by looking at it through a different lens (video pun intended).

909,Daniel C.,Gosport,"Medical Doctor - Writer, editor, proofreader","I am a medical doctor with experience of clinical practice and working as Senior Medical Adviser for a large pharmaceutical company. I am highly experienced in writing training materials and manuals on complex medical and scientific topics, to educate sales and marketing teams as well as laymen. I&#039;m also highly skilled at proofreading and editing medical and scientific material, as I had responsibility for reviewing and approving all marketing and training materials on behalf of the company, ensuring compliance with UK law - a task that requires a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach.

My passion is making the complex easy to understand and engaging. I do this in a number of ways, including by determining which information is essential and which is superfluous; by breaking down large topics into digestible chunks; and by using analogies to simplify difficult topics. When writing or proofreading/editing, I always ensure the overall tone of the piece reflects the intended audience - something which is commonly overlooked.

I am reliable, I take my work seriously and am used to working to deadlines.

911,George F.,Bury St Edmunds,Photographer and Stop Motion Animator,"Hi, I’m George!

As well as being a Gregg’s pastry aficionado, I work with brilliant brands to create some pretty amazing commercial advertising, branded product photography, social media content and stop motion animation. I’ve been working with creative folks across UK, US, Asia and Europe (still no love from Australasia/Antarctica though, hit me up guys!) specialising in portraiture, product photography, 360 product photography and stop motion animation for over 12 years. A few of these fantastic people have been from the likes of Kerrang!, Hartley’s, Total Guitar,  Mattel, Rhythm, Disney, JoJo Maman Bebe, Comic Relief, the BBC, DHL and Jägermeister.

I was born in Chicago where I crafted my love of photography; taking photos of the incredible people and architecture that I was surrounded by. I was awarded a photography scholarship to Art Institute of Seattle, but couldn’t bring myself to leave my beloved Chicago (and Italian Beef sandwiches – if you know you know!). Cut to three years later I put down my camera, joined the US Air Force and ended up stationed in England, for those keeping track at home yes that is a full 1,882 miles extra in the totally opposite direction of Seattle.

I quickly fell in love with the country and back in love with my first passion, photography. So once I left the Air Force I decided to keep the love affair going with both. I now live near Cambridge and regularly work from my studio here and on location in London. Because of this I’m fortunate to be able to create advertising portraiture, product photography and stop motion animation both locally and globally. I thrive on tackling creative challenges and dare anyone to beat me in a Greggs sausage roll eating contest. I love working with people and helping my clients to capture genuine moments, humour and the personalities of the my subjects, especially when I get to help craft moments for families looking for portraiture that is utterly unique to them.

If you think I could be a good fit for your next project, or feel like taking me on in a pastry eating contest (invitation also applies to Rustlers) contact me today.

I stand for professionalism and quality. You can rely on me.

What makes me a good copywriter and translator? 

I adapt my style to the company, and the target audience the company is addressing. I call this &quot;sound&quot;. How does your company want to sound? Corporate communication plays into this.
When translating, it&#039;s not just translating, it&#039;s localizing.
How is spoken locally in the particular language and which proverbs and colloquial words are used, I take all this into account when I overestimate.

Each order is discussed in detail beforehand, especially related to the price. We can agree on a fixed price for each quality, as well as an adjusted hourly rate for each task. Both parties always have a fixed security.

I enjoy working with artists and companies that have ideals which align with my own. These ideals are based on valuing clients, collaborators, the environment and the communities we live in.

955,Letacio Magalhaes G.,Sao Carlos,"RPA Process Automation (Desktop, browser) Developer","Interest in automating tasks and creating better usability for every day softwares and tasks.

I like to work smart and to solve pratical problems. The less time and brain power one uses for repetitive tasks, the more time one will have to focus on bringing value to a business.

That&#039;s what i love to do. To make peoples life easier.

I&#039;ve been using Autohotkey for 3 years by now, to make both my own work and my colleagues work easier, and faster.

I do this by customizing hotkeys and creating user interfaces to help me with speed texting, formating, automatic data inserting/retrieving, report generating and whatever other tasks are needed to be automated.

Highlights of what I&#039;ve developed so far:

(A and A.1 items are the biggest effort saving in my daily work, and currently the applications I am most proud of)

A. Getting a JIRA report:

You company uses jira to organize the work. How many issues were created this month? How many of them are already closed? How much hours were logged on a determined set of issues? Which jiras still need attention? How much work a particular worker has logged today?

I&#039;ve built an interface to display and calculate all this data, without even opening the browser. It works through Jira&#039;s REST API. Click a button, and retrieve (or insert) the data you need. Im replicating this software to my own JIRA account, as there are sensitive data from my previous company inside my coding. I&#039;ll be posting a video from this functionality soon.

A.1. Loggining work to jira with a button click:

You need to log your time in different tasks everyday, but do not wish to open every single task in browser and type data in each one, one by one? I&#039;ve developed an interface where you write all your date (activities and time worked) and it inserts directly in Jira through REST API. Again, click a button, and it&#039;s done.

B. Integrating with voice recognition software so the shortcuts don&#039;t need to be mouse/keyboard inserted. Talk to your computer, and it does what you want it to (and even talks back to you, if you want).

C. Customized answer shortcuts for online marketing consumer service:
Writting shortcuts so you can send big text chunks in no time

D. Customized formatted texts:
If you need to always write a text with formated data, for instance, you need to make a list (1,2,3,4,5) why not type a shortcut, and the list is created for you? This way, you only fill the list, with no need to format it.

E. Shortcuts for applications/folders/file handling, and so on:

Type shortcuts and calculator/notepad/browsers/music players, or any other application you have on computer will be started. Same for folders. I you want to see your personal files folder often, a shortcut can make it opened with no effort.

F. Taking screenshot of particular part of screen, and renaming the file with a numeric sequence (picture1, picture2, picture3). 

In this one, I say to my computer: Take screenshot.
It takes the screenshot and answers me (&quot;Your screenshot has been taken&quot;). It&#039;s actually very cool. I feel just like Iron Man ;)

G. Inserting data on websites/logging in automatically:
Set your password and account (or any other info), and type the shortcut. It will insert your data right away, without needing to type everything over and over again.

H. I&#039;ve worked with software testing, so i have a good background in agile development process. I&#039;m also good at picking up details, and understanding user needs to deliver a good user experience.

956,Shravan S.,Bengaluru,Rust Developer - Blockchain | Web,"⚡Are you looking to create a blockchain application? 
⚡Are you looking to create a complex web application that is elegant and performant? 
⚡Do you prioritise quality over quantity? 

If you are, then I am the perfect technology partner for you! 💸💸💸 

✨ How can I help you with your blockchain application? ✨
I can create smart contracts to an entire blockchain tailored to your application - the exact solution will depend on your project. I mostly work in the solana and cosmos ecosystems but due to my strong blockchain fundamentals I can create applications on any chain, even the most obscure ones. If your blockchain project is complex and is not just minting NFT&#039;s, then I will be a good fit.

✨ How can I help you with your web application? ✨
I specialise on complex web applications that cannot be created using a content management system or static site generator. If your looking to create a prototype I can create it all by myself, you will not need to hire multiple developers for frontend, backend and devops. I create web applications using the &quot;Rust&quot; programming language ensuring that your application has no security issues and has top tier performance.  If your web application is created using &quot;Rust&quot;, I can help fix or modify it based on your requirement.

✨ When would I be a great fit? ✨
You are looking for a solana blockchain developer
You are looking for a web application prototyper
You are looking for a rust developer
You care about clean code

✨ When would I not be a great fit? ✨
You want to sell NFT&#039;s that have no real use case
”Respect for others” is not a core value for you

✨ Why choose me over someone else? ✨
Client Reviews - I focus on providing value to all of my clients and earning their trust.
Over-Delivering - My focus is on giving more than what I expect to receive.
Responsiveness - Will respond to any messages immediately or in a few hours.

No matter what software I make for you I will make sure its of the best quality. I pride myself on my ability to write elegant code. I will exploit all the features of whatever programming language I use to come up with the most performant and easy to maintain code. I am well versed with design patterns and will use the most fitting design pattern based on the situation.

Some additional info about me - 

I do most of my software development with the &quot;Rust&quot; programming language. I ❤️‍🔥 the Rust programming language 🦀. I have tried various programming languages and rust is by far my favourite - Its the only programming language that allows me to build anything in software from full stack web apps. embedded systems, operating systems, games .etc. It has the performance of a low level programming language like C/C++ while having the developer experience of high level programming language such as C#/Golang .etc. If you are looking for a rustacean, you have found one!

Following is a brief description of my development environment. I use Ubuntu as my operating system. I use Intellij IDEA community edition as my IDE, with the VIM plugin to ensure I am editing code in the fastest possible way. My IDE has various plugins that help with intellisense, linting and formatting. I also use various tools such as github copilot to get AI generated recommendation which speeds up my  programming drastically.

959,Matthew G.,Chicago,Sales Copywriter: High-Converting Sales Copy for Online Businesses,"So, you&#039;re willing to invest in the BEST email copywriter on Upwork, huh?

&quot;Matt takes the time to understand your business needs and goals. I plan to continue working with him  in the future and highly recommend his services to anyone that needs copywriting!&quot;
- Zak Khoshbin, CEO of Pur360

&quot;I would DEFINITELY recommend Matt. We hired him to review the initial build of a webpage for our marketing agency... he went above and beyond what we asked for.&quot;
- Colby Flood, CEO of Brighter Click

Then repeat after me:

&quot;At my level, it&#039;s worth getting a professional to do my sales copy.&quot;

The problem is, you&#039;re on Upwork. Which isn&#039;t known for... well, you know... good copy.

So if you&#039;re turning over a healthy 6 figures, and you&#039;re looking for world-class email strategy and copy... where do you go?

That&#039;s where I can help.

My name&#039;s Matt, and unlike 99% of sales copywriters on Upwork, I focus on ONE thing: high-converting email automations for Ecommerce businesses.

And by doing that, I can put together a better email strategy than anyone on this site.

A big claim? Yeah. But trust me - I&#039;ve been here a while, and I&#039;ve seen most of the competition.

It&#039;s not too hard to spot a rookie writer:

❌ Telling you how they&#039;ll &quot;connect&quot; with your audience... when their OWN PROFILE is so dull it nearly puts you into a coma.

❌ &quot;Specializing&quot; in every kind of copy under the sun: VSLs, sales pages, blog posts, emails, etc.

❌ Boasting about how they &quot;get&quot; the difference between &quot;features&quot; and &quot;benefits&quot;

You get the picture...

OK, now let&#039;s get serious:

If you&#039;re at the point where optimizing your email strategy or improving your sales funnel can mean thousands of dollars... you KNOW good copy and strategy is worth investing in.

So... why can you trust ME to do it?

Well firstly... my results. My glowing reviews aside, I&#039;ve:

✔ Contributed to $5 million+ in backend sales

✔ Have worked with some of the biggest brands out there, including Dr. Kellyann, Nature M.D., Darn Good Yarn, TruLabs, Renu Herbs, etc.

✔ Have worked as an Email Marketing Manager for one of the biggest email agencies out there

Yada, yada... you get the picture.

What&#039;s more, my approach is a little unusual:

📌 NO SCAMMY COPY: You don&#039;t need outrageous claims and stretched-out proof to sell your products. Together, we&#039;ll figure out how to sell your customers while being true to yourself.

📌 NO EGO: Most writers get offended if you touch one word of their copy. But in online businesses, your brand voice matters! I welcome your feedback to help make it &quot;sound like you.&quot;

📌 NO CRAZY CLAIMS: Contrary to many eager rookies, pros know that the best copy can&#039;t do the job alone. You NEED a good list and a good product/service (and I&#039;ll ask you to prove it before I work with you).

Look, I&#039;m confident you won&#039;t find a better email marketer on Upwork.

But if you&#039;re sold on me - hold on a sec.

Before you go ahead and offer me a job, you need to know something: I&#039;m picky on taking on new work.

No, seriously.

At the moment, I have plenty of steady clients off Upwork that keep me busy.

So here&#039;s the catch:

We&#039;re NOT a good fit if...

❌ You or your business is making less than six figures.

❌ You&#039;re on a tight deadline and can&#039;t wait at LEAST a week for me to start.

❌ You don&#039;t have testimonials or proof that your product is ethical and awesome (rule of thumb: if I wouldn&#039;t pitch it to my mom, I won&#039;t write copy for it.)

This isn&#039;t a gimmick. It&#039;s just that if you qualify as my client, you get my absolute best.

Now remember, I can make YOU millions, and help YOU change lives. I&#039;m easily worth it.

But if you want my help, you&#039;re going to have to convince me you are, you.

Still eager to work together?
